       "  'content': 'BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for\\nLanguage Understanding\\nJacob Devlin\\nMing-Wei Chang\\nKenton Lee\\nKristina Toutanova\\nGoogle AI Language\\n{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout}@google.com\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce a new language representa-\\ntion model called BERT, which stands for\\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from\\nTransformers. Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful.\\nIt obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches.\\nThe ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder\\nRepresentations\\nfrom\\nTransformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).\\nThe\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\narXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019\\nword based only on its context.\\nUnlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks.\\nThe code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1\\nUnsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods.\\nPre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014).\\nTo train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2\\nUnsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text\\n(Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch.\\nAt least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).\\nLeft-to-right language model-\\nBERT\\nBERT\\nE[CLS]\\nE1\\n E[SEP]\\n...\\nEN\\nE1’\\n...\\nEM’\\nC\\nT1\\nT[SEP]\\n...\\nTN\\nT1’\\n...\\nTM’\\n[CLS]\\nTok 1\\n [SEP]\\n...\\nTok N\\nTok 1\\n...\\nTokM\\nQuestion\\nParagraph\\nStart/End Span\\nBERT\\nE[CLS]\\nE1\\n E[SEP]\\n...\\nEN\\nE1’\\n...\\nEM’\\nC\\nT1\\nT[SEP]\\n...\\nTN\\nT1’\\n...\\nTM’\\n[CLS]\\nTok 1\\n [SEP]\\n...\\nTok N\\nTok 1\\n...\\nTokM\\nMasked Sentence A\\nMasked Sentence B\\nPre-training\\nFine-Tuning\\nNSP\\nMask LM\\nMask LM\\nUnlabeled Sentence A and B Pair \\nSQuAD\\nQuestion Answer Pair\\nNER\\nMNLI\\nFigure 1: Overall pre-training and ﬁne-tuning procedures for BERT. Apart from output layers, the same architec-\\ntures are used in both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3\\nTransfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3\\nBERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning.\\nDur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks.\\nFor ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture\\nBERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\\nInput/Output Representations\\nTo make BERT\\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\\n(e.g., ⟨Question, Answer ⟩) in one token sequence.\\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ([CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\\nas Ti ∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1\\nPre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM\\nIntuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model.\\nUnfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2:\\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext).\\nAs we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\\n[CLS]\\nhe\\nlikes\\nplay\\n##ing\\n[SEP]\\nmy\\ndog\\nis\\ncute\\n[SEP]\\nInput\\nE[CLS]\\nEhe\\nElikes\\nEplay\\nE##ing\\nE[SEP]\\nEmy\\nEdog\\nEis\\nEcute\\nE[SEP]\\nToken\\nEmbeddings\\nEA\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEB\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nEA\\nSegment\\nEmbeddings\\nE0\\nE6\\nE7\\nE8\\nE9\\nE10\\nE1\\nE2\\nE3\\nE4\\nE5\\nPosition\\nEmbeddings\\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2\\nFine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end.\\nAt the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text-∅pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4\\nExperiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1\\nGLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vector C ∈RH corresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nﬁne-tuning are classiﬁcation layer weights W ∈\\nRK×H, where K is the number of labels. We com-\\npute a standard classiﬁcation loss with C and W,\\ni.e., log(softmax(CW T )).\\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.\\nSystem\\nMNLI-(m/mm)\\nQQP\\nQNLI\\nSST-2\\nCoLA\\nSTS-B\\nMRPC\\nRTE\\nAverage\\n392k\\n363k\\n108k\\n67k\\n8.5k\\n5.7k\\n3.5k\\n2.5k\\n-\\nPre-OpenAI SOTA\\n80.6/80.1\\n66.1\\n82.3\\n93.2\\n35.0\\n81.0\\n86.0\\n61.7\\n74.0\\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn\\n76.4/76.1\\n64.8\\n79.8\\n90.4\\n36.0\\n73.3\\n84.9\\n56.8\\n71.0\\nOpenAI GPT\\n82.1/81.4\\n70.3\\n87.4\\n91.3\\n45.4\\n80.0\\n82.3\\n56.0\\n75.1\\nBERTBASE\\n84.6/83.4\\n71.2\\n90.5\\n93.5\\n52.1\\n85.8\\n88.9\\n66.4\\n79.6\\nBERTLARGE\\n86.7/85.9\\n72.1\\n92.7\\n94.9\\n60.5\\n86.5\\n89.3\\n70.1\\n82.1\\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).\\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples.

The effect of model\\nsize is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\\n4.2\\nSQuAD v1.1\\nThe\\nStanford\\nQuestion\\nAnswering\\nDataset\\n(SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowd-\\nsourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al.,\\n2016).\\nGiven a question and a passage from\\n9The GLUE data set distribution does not include the Test\\nlabels, and we only made a single GLUE evaluation server\\nsubmission for each of BERTBASE and BERTLARGE.\\n10https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard\\nWikipedia containing the answer, the task is to\\npredict the answer text span in the passage.\\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answer-\\ning task, we represent the input question and pas-\\nsage as a single packed sequence, with the ques-\\ntion using the A embedding and the passage using\\nthe B embedding. We only introduce a start vec-\\ntor S ∈RH and an end vector E ∈RH during\\nﬁne-tuning. The probability of word i being the\\nstart of the answer span is computed as a dot prod-\\nuct between Ti and S followed by a softmax over\\nall of the words in the paragraph: Pi =\\neS·Ti\\nP\\nj eS·Tj .\\nThe analogous formula is used for the end of the\\nanswer span. The score of a candidate span from\\nposition i to position j is deﬁned as S·Ti + E·Tj,\\nand the maximum scoring span where j ≥i is\\nused as a prediction. The training objective is the\\nsum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and\\nend positions. We ﬁne-tune for 3 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well\\nas results from top published systems (Seo et al.,\\n2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Hu et al., 2018). The top results from the\\nSQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public\\nsystem descriptions available,11 and are allowed to\\nuse any public data when training their systems.\\nWe therefore use modest data augmentation in\\nour system by ﬁrst ﬁne-tuning on TriviaQA (Joshi\\net al., 2017) befor ﬁne-tuning on SQuAD.\\nOur best performing system outperforms the top\\nleaderboard system by +1.5 F1 in ensembling and\\n+1.3 F1 as a single system. In fact, our single\\nBERT model outperforms the top ensemble sys-\\ntem in terms of F1 score. Without TriviaQA ﬁne-\\n11QANet is described in Yu et al.

The\\nonly task-speciﬁc parameters introduced is a vec-\\ntor whose dot product with the [CLS] token rep-\\nresentation C denotes a score for each choice\\nwhich is normalized with a softmax layer.\\nWe ﬁne-tune the model for 3 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask.\\nIn Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2\\nEffect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6.\\nHowever, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\\nmixed results on the downstream task impact of\\nincreasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two\\nto four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3\\nFeature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data. Following standard practice, we for-\\nmulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\\nHyperparams\\nDev Set Accuracy\\n#L\\n#H #A LM (ppl) MNLI-m MRPC SST-2\\n3\\n768\\n12\\n5.84\\n77.9\\n79.8\\n88.4\\n6\\n768\\n3\\n5.24\\n80.6\\n82.2\\n90.7\\n6\\n768\\n12\\n4.68\\n81.9\\n84.8\\n91.3\\n12\\n768\\n12\\n3.99\\n84.4\\n86.7\\n92.9\\n12 1024\\n16\\n3.54\\n85.7\\n86.9\\n93.3\\n24 1024\\n16\\n3.23\\n86.6\\n87.8\\n93.7\\nTable 6:\\nAblation over BERT model size. #L = the\\nnumber of layers; #H = hidden size; #A = number of at-\\ntention heads. “LM (ppl)” is the masked LM perplexity\\nof held-out training data.\\nSystem\\nDev F1 Test F1\\nELMo (Peters et al., 2018a)\\n95.7\\n92.2\\nCVT (Clark et al., 2018)\\n-\\n92.6\\nCSE (Akbik et al., 2018)\\n-\\n93.1\\nFine-tuning approach\\nBERTLARGE\\n96.6\\n92.8\\nBERTBASE\\n96.4\\n92.4\\nFeature-based approach (BERTBASE)\\nEmbeddings\\n91.0\\n-\\nSecond-to-Last Hidden\\n95.6\\n-\\nLast Hidden\\n94.9\\n-\\nWeighted Sum Last Four Hidden\\n95.9\\n-\\nConcat Last Four Hidden\\n96.1\\n-\\nWeighted Sum All 12 Layers\\n95.5\\n-\\nTable 7: CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition re-\\nsults.

We use the representation of\\nthe ﬁrst sub-token as the input to the token-level\\nclassiﬁer over the NER label set.\\nTo ablate the ﬁne-tuning approach, we apply the\\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\\ntions from one or more layers without ﬁne-tuning\\nany parameters of BERT.

In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\\nizing these ﬁndings to deep bidirectional architec-\\ntures, allowing the same pre-trained model to suc-\\ncessfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\\nReferences\\nAlan Akbik, Duncan Blythe, and Roland Vollgraf.\\n2018.

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\nery input token.\\nAdditionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability. In\\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce-\\ndure.\\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\\npre-training steps may be required for the model\\nBERT (Ours)\\nTrm\\nTrm\\nTrm\\nTrm\\nTrm\\nTrm\\n...\\n...\\nTrm\\nTrm\\nTrm\\nTrm\\nTrm\\nTrm\\n...\\n...\\nOpenAI GPT\\nLstm\\nELMo\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\nLstm\\n T1\\nT2\\n TN\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n E1\\nE2\\n EN\\n...\\n T1\\nT2\\nTN\\n...\\n E1\\nE2\\n EN\\n...\\n T1\\nT2\\n TN\\n...\\n E1\\nE2\\n EN\\n...\\nFigure 3: Differences in pre-training model architectures. BERT uses a bidirectional Transformer. OpenAI GPT\\nuses a left-to-right Transformer. ELMo uses the concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-\\nleft LSTMs to generate features for downstream tasks. Among the three, only BERT representations are jointly\\nconditioned on both left and right context in all layers. In addition to the architecture differences, BERT and\\nOpenAI GPT are ﬁne-tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.\\nto converge. In Section C.1 we demonstrate that\\nMLM does converge marginally slower than a left-\\nto-right model (which predicts every token), but\\nthe empirical improvements of the MLM model\\nfar outweigh the increased training cost.\\nNext Sentence Prediction\\nThe next sentence\\nprediction task can be illustrated in the following\\nexamples.\\nInput = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\\nLabel = IsNext\\nInput = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\\nLabel = NotNext\\nA.2\\nPre-training Procedure\\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sam-\\nple two spans of text from the corpus, which we\\nrefer to as “sentences” even though they are typ-\\nically much longer than single sentences (but can\\nbe shorter also). The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is ≤512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus.\\nWe\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERTBASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3\\nFine-tuning Procedure\\nFor ﬁne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs. The dropout probability was always\\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\\nare task-speciﬁc, but we found the following range\\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\\n• Batch size: 16, 32\\n13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/Cloud-\\nTPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global-\\navailability.html\\n• Learning rate (Adam): 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\\n• Number of epochs: 2, 3, 4\\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,\\n100k+ labeled training examples) were far less\\nsensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data\\nsets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea-\\nsonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\\nperforms best on the development set.\\nA.4\\nComparison of BERT, ELMo ,and\\nOpenAI GPT\\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\\napproach.\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and\\nclassiﬁer token ([CLS]) which are only in-\\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.\\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5\\nIllustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks. In\\nthe ﬁgure, E represents the input embedding, Ti\\nrepresents the contextual representation of token i,\\n[CLS] is the special symbol for classiﬁcation out-\\nput, and [SEP] is the special symbol to separate\\nnon-consecutive token sequences.\\nB\\nDetailed Experimental Setup\\nB.1\\nDetailed Descriptions for the GLUE\\nBenchmark Experiments.\\nOur\\nGLUE\\nresults\\nin\\nTable1\\nare\\nobtained\\nfrom\\nhttps://gluebenchmark.com/\\nleaderboard\\nand\\nhttps://blog.\\nopenai.com/language-unsupervised.\\nThe GLUE benchmark includes the following\\ndatasets, the descriptions of which were originally\\nsummarized in Wang et al.

This allows us to answer the following\\nquestions:\\n1. Question:\\nDoes BERT really need such\\na large amount of pre-training (128,000\\nwords/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve\\nhigh ﬁne-tuning accuracy?\\nAnswer: Yes, BERTBASE achieves almost\\n1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when\\ntrained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\\n2.

Advances in deep\\nlearning and machine learning algorithms have enabled breakthroughs in computer\\nvision, speech recognition, natural language processing and beyond, motivating\\nresearchers to leverage AI techniques to improve software development efﬁciency.\\nThus, the fast-emerging research area of “AI for Code” has garnered new interest\\nand gathered momentum. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset CodeNet,\\nconsisting of over 14 million code samples and about 500 million lines of code\\nin 55 different programming languages, which is aimed at teaching AI to code.\\nIn addition to its large scale, CodeNet has a rich set of high-quality annotations\\nto benchmark and help accelerate research in AI techniques for a variety of crit-\\nical coding tasks, including code similarity and classiﬁcation, code translation\\nbetween a large variety of programming languages, and code performance (runtime\\nand memory) improvement techniques.

AI can manipulate and generate computer code, but can it do so with\\nhigh quality? Many researchers are fascinated by this possibility, encouraged by AI successes in\\nother domains and tantalized by the vision of computers programming computers. Some recent\\ndeep-learning models [3, 4] for code have received a lot of publicity: trained on vast amounts of\\ndata and using novel architectures with billions of parameters, they sometimes generate surprisingly\\nplausible code.\\nPreprint. Under review.\\narXiv:2105.12655v2  [cs.SE]  29 Aug 2021\\nGiven the success of non-AI tools for code, why should we consider AI to augment or possibly\\nreplace them? Firstly, AI can help reﬁne and re-tune the heuristics used by traditional coding tools.\\nSecondly, based on the training data from past experience, AI can help prioritize when there is more\\nthan one sound answer [5]. Thirdly, an AI-based tool may handle incomplete or invalid code more\\nrobustly, thus expanding its scope. Finally, AI can incorporate signals usually ignored by traditional\\ntools for code, such as the natural language in identiﬁers or comments.\\nIn the enterprise environment, developers often face code written by large teams over many years\\nand geographies. Developers must manipulate such code to modernize it, ﬁx bugs, improve its\\nperformance, evolve it when requirements change, make it more secure, and/or comply with regu-\\nlations. These tasks are challenging, and it is crucial to provide tool support for developers to be\\nmore productive at performing them. It is well known that the latest advancements in deep learning\\nalgorithms rely on best-of-breed datasets, such as ImageNet, to create increasingly complex and\\npowerful models. In this paper, we present \"CodeNet\", a ﬁrst-of-its-kind dataset in scale, diversity,\\nand quality, to accelerate the algorithmic advances in AI for Code.\\nTo promote widespread adoption of CodeNet, we will be launching contests involving use cases based\\non the dataset. The ﬁrst contest [6] will focus on diversity, inclusion and spurring interest among\\naspiring data scientists. We are partnering with the Global Women in Data Science organization (with\\npresence in over 50 countries) founded by Stanford University [7] and targeting teams with at least\\nﬁfty percent women. We are planning follow-up contests that target experienced AI practitioners.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the CodeNet dataset. Related\\ndatasets are discussed in Section 3, and the differentiation of CodeNet with respect to these related\\ndatasets is elaborated in Section 4. Section 5 describes how CodeNet was curated and Section 6\\nenumerates the usability features of CodeNet with several pre-processing tools to transform source\\ncodes into representations that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models. Section 7\\ndiscusses the upcoming CodeNet contest and Section 8 describes important baseline experiments\\nwith the CodeNet dataset. Section 9 presents further uses of the CodeNet dataset and Section 10\\nconcludes the paper.\\n2\\nThe CodeNet Dataset\\nThe CodeNet dataset consists of a large collection of code samples with extensive metadata. It\\nalso contains documented tools to transform code samples into intermediate representations and to\\naccess the dataset and make tailored selections. Our goal is to provide the community with a large,\\nhigh-quality curated dataset that can be used to advance AI techniques for source code.\\nCodeNet is derived from the data available on two online judge websites: AIZU [8] and AtCoder [9].\\nOnline judge websites pose programming problems in the form of courses and contests. The dataset\\nconsists of submissions to these problems, which are judged by an automated review process for\\ncorrectness. Problem descriptions, submission outcomes, and associated metadata are available via\\nvarious REST APIs.\\nScale and Statistics. CodeNet contains a total of 13,916,868 submissions, divided into 4053\\nproblems. Among the submissions, 53.6% (7,460,588) are accepted (compilable and pass the\\nprescribed tests), 29.5% are marked with wrong answer, and the remaining rejected due to their\\nfailure to meet run time or memory requirements. To our knowledge, this is the largest dataset so\\nfar among similar kinds. Submissions are in 55 different languages; 95% of them are coded in C++,\\nPython, Java, C, Ruby, and C#. C++ is the most common language, with 8,008,527 submissions (57%\\nof the total), of which 4,353,049 are accepted. With the abundance of code samples, users can extract\\nlarge benchmark datasets that are customized to their downstream use. See Figure 1 for a summary.\\nDiversity. The problems in CodeNet are mainly pedagogical and range from elementary exercises\\nto sophisticated problems that require advanced algorithms. The submitters range from beginners\\nto experienced coders. Some submissions are correct while others contain different types of errors,\\naccordingly labeled. The submissions are in many different languages.\\nCode Samples. Each code sample is a single ﬁle and includes inputting the test cases and printing out\\nthe computed results. The ﬁle name uses standard extensions that denote the programming language,\\ne.g., .py for Python. The majority of code samples contain only one function, although submissions\\nto more complex problems might have several functions.\\n2\\n(a) Languages\\n(b) Status\\nFigure 1: Percentage of submissions per language (left) and per status (right).\\nMetadata. The metadata enables data queries and selections among the large collection of problems,\\nlanguages, and source ﬁles. The metadata is organized in a two level hierarchy. The ﬁrst is the\\ndataset level, which describes all problems. The second is the problem level, which details all the\\nsubmissions to a single problem. Metadata and data are separated in the dataset structure.\\nAt the dataset level, a single CSV ﬁle lists all problems and their origins, along with the CPU time\\nand memory limits set for them. Additionally, every problem has an HTML ﬁle with a detailed\\ndescription of the problem, the requirements and constraints, and the IO examples.\\nAt the problem level, every problem has a CSV ﬁle. The metadata for each submission is summarized\\nin Table 2 below, which lists the ﬁelds contained in each CSV ﬁle as well as the corresponding\\ndescriptions.\\n2.1\\nHow to read the CodeNet dataset\\nThe data and metadata are organized in a rigorous directory structure. The top level Project_CodeNet\\ndirectory contains several sub-directories:\\ndata, metadata, problem_descriptions, and\\nderived. The code samples or submissions reside under the data directory. The data directory\\nis organized as (problem_id)/(language)/(submission), so the ﬁle path data/p00023/C++/\\ns006384060.cpp denotes a submission to problem p00023 in C++ with id s006384060. Detailed\\nstatement of the problems can be found in problem_descriptions/(problem_id).html.

All code samples in CodeNet may not be extensively commented, and these comments\\nmay be in multitude of languages. Therefore, AI techniques that rely on learning from preponderance\\nof comments in the code may face challenges. The code samples are solutions to high-school and\\n4\\nFigure 2: Number of problems providing at least X submissions.

This dataset is not suitable for users looking for code\\nwith enterprise API’s and advanced design patterns.\\n3\\nRelated Datasets\\nA wide variety of datasets for source code exist, with many targeting one or a small number of\\ntasks. Such tasks include clone detection, vulnerability detection [10, 11], cloze test [12], code\\ncompletion [13, 14], code repair [15], code-to-code translation, natural language code search [16],\\ntext-to-code generation [17], and code summarization [16]. A detailed discussion of several of these\\ntasks and their respective datasets is available in CodeXGLUE [18], which is a collection of existing\\ndatasets. CodeNet, on the other hand, is a new dataset curated from scratch, that aims to support a\\nbroad set of use cases. Popular datasets of a similar kind are POJ-104 [19] (which is incorporated as\\npart of CodeXGLUE as well) and GCJ [20] (derived from Google Code Jam). We compare CodeNet\\nto these datasets in the following.\\n3.1\\nPOJ-104\\nPOJ-104 was collected from a pedagogical online judge system. The code samples are submissions\\nto 104 programming problems. With 500 submissions to each problem, there is a total of 52,000 code\\nsamples in the dataset. This dataset has been used by many authors for code classiﬁcation [19] and\\ncode similarity [21].\\nPOJ-104 is faced with several limitations.\\n1. The code samples are in C and C++, but the two languages are not distinguished. Although they are\\nclosely related, mixing them leads to parsing errors and a reduction of useful code samples [21].\\n2. Useful metadata such as the results of the judging system (acceptance, error types etc.) are missing.\\nTherefore, for certain applications where compilabilty or code correctness is important, additional\\npre-processing efforts are needed and useful code samples are reduced [21]. The dataset does\\nnot contain the problem statement, although some example problems are described in [22], and\\ninformation on how to execute the code samples is absent.\\n3. Some problems are identical (e.g., problems 26 and 62), and some submissions are near duplicates\\nof each other, although the percentage of such cases is low compared to other datasets.\\n3.2\\nGCJ\\nGCJ [20] was collected from the submissions to the Google Code Jam competitions from 2008 to\\n2020. Similar to CodeNet, the submissions cover a wide variety of programming languages, with\\nC++, Java, Python, and C being the predominant ones. The C++ subset has been extracted into a\\nPOJ-104-like benchmark and used in some publications. This benchmark dataset, GCJ-297 [23],\\nhas 297 problems and approximately 280K submissions. The number of submissions is imbalanced\\namong problems.\\n5\\nGCJ is advantageous over POJ-104 in size and language diversity, but we believe that an even\\nlarger dataset such as CodeNet can better serve the community. GCJ contains neither metadata nor\\ninformation on identical problems and near duplicates.\\n4\\nCodeNet Differentiation\\nTable 5: Related datasets comparison\\nCodeNet\\nGCJ\\nPOJ\\nTotal number of problems\\n4053\\n332\\n104\\nNumber of programming languages\\n55\\n20\\n2\\nTotal number of code samples\\n13,916,828\\n2,430,000\\n52,000\\nC++/C subset data size (code samples)\\n8,008,527\\n280,000\\n52,000\\nPercentage of problems with test data\\n51%\\n0%\\n0%\\nTask: Memory Consumption Prediction\\nYes\\nNo\\nNo\\nTask: Runtime Performance Comparison\\nYes\\nNo\\nNo\\nTask: Error Prediction\\nYes\\nNo\\nNo\\nTask: Near duplicate prediction\\nYes\\nNo\\nNo\\nA high quality code dataset has certain desired properties. We constructed CodeNet according to\\nthese requirements. In the following, we discuss how CodeNet differentiates itself from the existing\\ndatasets along these lines. Table 5 is a comparison with related datasets.\\nLarge scale. A useful dataset should contain a large number and variety of data samples to expose\\nthe realistic and complex landscape of data distributions one meets in practice. CodeNet is the\\nlargest dataset in its class - it has approximately 10 times more code samples than GCJ and its C++\\nbenchmark is approximately 10 times larger than POJ-104.\\nRich annotation. For the dataset class in question, it is important to include information beyond\\nwhich problem a code sample solves to enable a wide range of applications and use cases. It is useful\\nto know whether a code sample solves the problem correctly, and if not, the error category (e.g.,\\ncompilation error, runtime error, and out-of-memory error). Since the source code is supposed to\\nsolve a programming problem, it is advantageous to know the problem statement and have a sample\\ninput for execution and a sample output for validation. All such extra information is part of CodeNet\\nbut absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\\nClean samples. For effective machine learning, the data samples are expected to be independent\\nand identically distributed (iid); otherwise, the resulting performance metric could be signiﬁcantly\\ninﬂated [24]. The existence of duplicate and/or near duplicate code samples makes the iid assumption\\ndubious. Hence, it is crucial to identify the near duplicates. The presence of identical problems in the\\ndataset poses an even bigger issue. In CodeNet, we analyzed the code samples for (near) duplication\\nand used clustering to ﬁnd identical problems. This information is made available as part of the\\ndataset release but it is absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\\n5\\nConstruction of CodeNet\\n5.1\\nCollection of Code Samples\\nThe CodeNet dataset contains problems, submissions, and metadata, scraped from the AIZU and\\nAtCoder online judging systems. For AIZU, we used the provided REST APIs to download all the\\nmetadata. For AtCoder, due to the absence of a REST API, we scraped the problems, submissions,\\nand metadata directly from the web pages. We considered only public and non-empty submissions\\nthat did not contain errors or inconsistencies in the metadata. We manually merged the information\\nfrom the two sources and adopted a uniﬁed format to create a single dataset.\\n6\\n5.2\\nCleansing\\nBecause data are collected from different sources, we apply a consistent character encoding (UTF-8)\\non all raw data ﬁles. Additionally, we remove byte-order marks and use Unix-style line-feeds as the\\nline ending.\\nAs indicated in section 4, we identify near-duplicates. We follow Allamanis [24] and use Jaccard\\nsimilarity [25] as a metric to score code pairs. Each code sample is tokenized and stored as a\\nbag-of-tokens multiset. In our case, we keep all tokens except comments and preprocessor directives.\\nWe compute the set and multiset Jaccard indices and respectively use 0.9 and 0.8 as the near-duplicate\\nthresholds.\\nBesides similar code samples, identical problems are also likely because they have been gathered over\\nmany decades. We go through the problem description ﬁles (in HTML format) and apply fdupes to\\nextract identical problem pairs. Additionally, using the near-duplicate information calculated for code\\nsamples, we consider a problem pair to be a potential duplicate when the number of near-duplicate\\ncode pairs exceeds a threshold. Clustering of duplicate problems is illustrated by the graphs in\\nFigure 3, where each node denotes a problem and an edge between two nodes is labeled by the\\nnumber of near-duplicate code pairs. Each connected graph is then a cluster of potential duplicate\\nproblems and we manually inspect the problem descriptions to verify the correctness of this duplicate\\ndetection.\\np13\\n41\\np53\\n5\\np42\\n4\\n31\\n64\\np16\\n20\\np56\\n4\\n19\\np23\\n7\\np62\\n1\\n6\\np26\\n15\\n22\\np58\\n44\\np85\\n3\\n28\\nFigure 3: An example of a near-duplicate problem graph.\\n5.3\\nBenchmark Datasets\\nCodeNet has a rich set of code samples, and the user can assemble a customized benchmark according\\nto his/her need. Following POJ-104, we extracted benchmark datasets from CodeNet in C++, Python,\\nand Java. The benchmark characteristics are shown in Table 6. For the C++ benchmarks, the number\\nof problems and their solutions are chosen to make the benchmark challenging. The benchmarks are\\nﬁltered in the following ways. Each code sample is “unique” in the sense that it is not a near-duplicate\\nof another code sample. The same is true of each problem. Samples with a large fraction of dead code\\nare excluded. Each code sample has successfully passed through the tokenizer, the SPT generator,\\nand the graph generator, all described in the next section. This step is to ensure that proper processing\\ncan be done to convert a code sample to a machine learning model input.\\n6\\nCode Representation and Tools\\nMachine learning with source code requires proper abstractions of the code. The abstractions are\\ninstantiated as representations in speciﬁc formats. As a usability feature, we provide several pre-\\nprocessing tools to transform source codes into representations that can readily be used as inputs into\\nmachine learning models. They are described as follows.\\nTokenizer. We offer fast C implementations of tokenizers for C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.\\nAdditionally, the parse-tree generator described next can also produce token streams for C, C++, Java,\\nand Python and can easily be extended to more languages.\\nSimpliﬁed Parse Tree (SPT) Simpliﬁed parse trees are derived from parse trees generated using\\nANTLR4 [26]. We traverse the ANTLR4 parse tree and remove internal nodes that only have one\\nchild. By doing so, we maintain the essential structure of the parse tree while pruning out unnecessary\\nparser production rules. Finally, we adopt Aroma’s [27] naming convention: leaf nodes are named by\\n7\\ntheir literal strings and internal nodes are named by a concatenation of their children’s names (only\\nreserved words are kept while others are replaced by a hash mark #). We produce features for each\\nnode: (1) node type (token or parsing rule); (2) token type (e.g., an identiﬁer), when applicable; (3)\\nparsing rule type (e.g., an expression), when applicable; and (4) whether it is a reserved word. We\\nadopt an extensible JSON graph schema so that edges can be augmented with types when needed.\\nCurrently, we support generating SPTs for four languages: C, C++, Java, and Python. Table 6\\nsummarizes the SPT statistics for the four benchmarks.\\nTable 6: Benchmark statistics.\\nC++1000\\nC++1400\\nPython800\\nJava250\\n#problems\\n1,000\\n1,400\\n800\\n250\\n#samples\\n500,000\\n420,000\\n240,000\\n75,000\\n#SPT-nodes\\n188,449,294\\n198,258,050\\n55,744,550\\n25,449,640\\n#SPT-edges\\n187,949,294\\n197,838,050\\n55,504,550\\n25,374,640\\nCode graphs. We augment the tool chain with a code graph generator using WALA [28], a general\\nframework for program analysis. The backbone of a code graph is a system dependence graph, which\\nis an inter-procedural graph of program instructions (e.g. call, read) expressing control ﬂow and\\ndata ﬂow information as edges. We also generate inter-procedural control ﬂow graphs, which are\\ncontrol ﬂow graphs of all the methods in the program, stitched together to connect call sites with\\ntarget methods. Our code graph tool currently supports only Java and Python, but we plan to support\\nmore languages such as Javascript.\\n7\\nCodeNet Challenge\\nThe launch of CodeNet was well received by the AI community and the media, with coverage\\nfrom Forbes[29], VentureBeat[30], ZDNet[31] and others. Within a short span of 3 months, our\\ngithub received 1000 stars and has been forked over 119 times. Our vision is to use CodeNet as an\\numbrella to curate AI for code datasets for widespread adoption and to drive innovation in AI for\\ncode. To leverage the momentum of CodeNet, we will be launching CodeNet challenges to create\\nexcitement in the AI community. The ﬁrst contest [6] is mainly pedagogical and targets aspiring\\ndata scientists. In addition, we are partnering with the Global Women in Data Science organization\\n(with presence in over 50 countries) founded by Stanford University [7] to emphasize diversity and\\ninclusion (teams must have at least ﬁfty percent women). We will organize workshops to introduce\\nthe topic, code similarity, and provide educational materials. This contest will be kicked off in late\\nSeptember and the winner will be announced in early December, around the NeurIPS2021 time\\nframe. The conclusion of the ﬁrst contest will be followed by a contest that will target experienced AI\\npractitioners. Potential contest topics will revolve around practical and compelling use cases such as\\ncode language translation, code repair, code performance improvement, and code memory reduction.\\n8\\nExperiments with the CodeNet Dataset\\nIn this section, we report the results of a code classiﬁcation task, a similarity task, a generalization\\ntask, and a token inference task, using the four benchmark datasets (see Table 6) extracted from\\nCodeNet. For this paper, these experiments are not meant to achieve the best-of-breed results using\\nthe state of the art. Our intention is to provide a set of baseline results as a reference. The experiments\\nare typically performed on a Xeon machine using P100 or V100 GPUs. Code and scripts for these\\nexperiments are in the model-experiments folder of the CodeNet repository [32].\\n8.1\\nCode Classiﬁcation\\nIn the classiﬁcation task, each problem corresponds to a class: a code sample belongs to a class if it\\nis a submission to the corresponding problem. For each experiment, 20% of the code samples are\\nused for testing, while the rest are split in 4:1 for training and validation, respectively. We experiment\\nwith a diverse set of machine learning methods: bag of tokens, sequence of tokens, BERT model, and\\ngraph neural networks (GNNs).\\n8\\n1. MLP with bag of tokens. A code sample is represented by a vector of relative frequencies of\\ntoken occurrences. Only operator and keyword tokens are used. The model is a 3-layer multilayer\\nperceptron (MLP).\\n2. CNN with token sequence. We use the same set of tokens as above but retain their order to form\\na sequence. All sequences have the same length under zero padding. The classiﬁcation model is a\\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) with an initial token embedding layer.\\n3. C-BERT with token sequence. Treating a code sample as a piece of natural language text, we\\nbuild a C-BERT model [33] through pretraining on 10K top starred Github projects written in C.\\nWe use the Clang C tokenizer and Sentencepiece to tokenize each code sample. The pretrained\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned on each benchmark.\\n4. GNN with SPT. Based on the parse tree representation, we use graph convolutional networks\\n(GCN) [34] and graph isomorphism networks (GIN) [35] as well as their variants as the prediction\\nmodel. The variant adds a virtual node to the graph to enhance graph message passing [36].\\n5. GNN with Code Graph. We also apply GCN on the code graph representation of the code.\\nTable 7: Classiﬁcation accuracy (in %).\\nJava250\\nPython800\\nC++1000\\nC++1400\\nMLP w/ bag of tokens\\n71.00±0.29\\n67.80±0.15\\n68.26±0.21\\n64.50±0.13\\nCNN w/ token sequence\\n89.52±0.59\\n87.46±0.25\\n93.96±0.18\\n93.71±0.18\\nC-BERT\\n97.40±0.19\\n97.09±0.18\\n93.79±0.01\\n91.83±0.06\\nGNN (GCN)\\n92.70±0.25\\n93.82±0.16\\n95.76±0.12\\n95.26±0.13\\nGNN (GCN-V)\\n93.02±0.81\\n94.30±0.15\\n96.09±0.17\\n95.73±0.07\\nGNN (GIN)\\n93.26±0.23\\n94.17±0.19\\n96.34±0.15\\n95.95±0.13\\nGNN (GIN-V)\\n92.77±0.66\\n94.54±0.12\\n96.64±0.10\\n96.36±0.10\\nCode Graph+GCN\\n94.10±.001\\n87.80±.007\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nTable 7 summarizes the classiﬁcation accuracy for all models on all benchmarks. Despite the\\nsimplicity of bag of tokens, it achieves well over 60% accuracy. Maintaining token ordering,\\nCNN with token sequence offers signiﬁcant improvement, reaching approximately 90% across all\\nbenchmarks.\\nMore complex neural models sometimes further improve the prediction performance, as witnessed by\\nC-BERT, which reaches approximately 97% for both Java and Python. It is interesting to note that\\neven though C-BERT is pre-trained with C programs, its performance on the two C++ benchmarks is\\nless impressive. We speculate that such a lower performance is related to programming practices. For\\nC++, it is common to have identical program construction, such as declaration of constants (e.g., pi\\nand epsilon) and data structures, appear across C++ submissions to different problems, but such a\\npractice is rare in Java and Python.\\nOverall, the GNN models exhibit competitive performance. They are consistently the top performers,\\nif not the best. The code graph representation slightly improves over the SPT representation on Java,\\nbut performs less well on Python.\\nFurther details of each model, along with the experiment environment, are given below.\\n8.1.1\\nDetails of Experiments on Code Classiﬁcation\\nMLP with Bag of Tokens\\nOne of the simplest representations of a code sample is a bag of tokens. Here, the code sample is\\nrepresented by a vector of relative frequencies of token occurrences in the source code. The vector is\\ncomputed by the following steps:\\n1. Convert a given source code into a sequence of tokens using a tokenizer (i.e., lexical analyzer).\\n2. From this sequence, remove the tokens considered not useful for code classiﬁcation.\\n3. Count the number of each token type in the reduced sequence and form a vector of counts.\\n4. Normalize the vector with respect to L2 norm.\\nWe do not use all tokens available in the grammar of the programming language. Only some operators\\nand keywords are used. All identiﬁers, comments and literals are ignored. We also ignore some\\n9\\noperators and many keywords that in our opinion provide no signiﬁcant information on the algorithm\\nthe source code implements.\\nThe vector representing a bag of tokens has the same length for every code sample, which makes\\nit convenient for processing with a neural network. The vector is usually short, which makes\\ntraining of a neural network fast. However, in a bag-of-tokens representation, information about the\\nnumber of occurrences and position of each token is lost. Hence, the accuracy of a classiﬁer using a\\nbag-of-tokens representation is rather limited.\\nTable 8 provides results of code classiﬁcation of all four benchmarks. The columns give the benchmark\\nname, the test accuracy, the number of training epochs, the run time of each epoch, and the number\\nof token types considered. All networks are implemented using Keras API of TensorFlow machine\\nlearning tool. Training is performed on a single V100 GPU, using Adam optimizer with learning rate\\n1e-3, and batches of 32 samples. In each experiment, 20% of the samples are used for testing, while\\nthe rest are split in 4:1 for training and validation, respectively.\\nTable 8: Code classiﬁcation by MLP with bag of tokens.\\nBenchmark\\nAccuracy\\nNumber\\nRun time\\nNumber\\ndataset\\n%%\\nepochs\\nsec/epoch\\ntokens\\nJava250\\n71.00±0.29\\n30\\n2\\n81\\nPython800\\n67.80±0.15\\n22\\n7\\n71\\nC++1000\\n68.26±0.21\\n20\\n14\\n56\\nC++1400\\n64.50±0.13\\n17\\n12\\n56\\nFigure 4 shows the neural network used for solving the classiﬁcation problem for the C++1400\\nbenchmark. The neural networks used for classiﬁcation of other benchmarks are similar to this one.\\nAs we see in Table 8 their performance is quite similar.\\nFigure 4: MLP architecture for code classiﬁcation.\\nFrom Table 8 we see that training is rather fast, the reason being that the network is simple. In\\nspite of simplicity, this neural network performs very well. The 64.50±0.13% test accuracy for\\nC++1400 benchmark dataset is signiﬁcantly better than the potential 0.071% accuracy of random\\nguess. It indicates that the relative frequencies of source code tokens provide sufﬁcient information\\nfor classifying code.\\nCNN with Token Sequence\\nThe sequence-of-tokens representation retains more information of a code sample than the bag-of-\\n10\\ntokens representation. For our experiments on code classiﬁcation, we use the same set of tokens that\\nis used in the above bag-of-tokens approach. Similarly, we omit all comments and identiﬁers.\\nTable 9: Code classiﬁcation by CNN with token sequence.\\nBenchmark\\nAccuracy\\nNumber\\nRun time\\nNumber\\ndataset\\n%%\\nepochs\\nsec/epoch\\ntokens\\nJava250\\n89.52±0.59\\n810\\n10\\n81\\nPython800\\n87.46±0.25\\n504\\n26\\n71\\nC++1000\\n93.96±0.18\\n235\\n59\\n56\\nC++1400\\n93.71±0.18\\n334\\n60\\n56\\nTable 9 shows results of code classiﬁcation on all four benchmarks by using the sequence-of-tokens\\nrepresentation. The columns give the benchmark name, the test accuracy, the number of training\\nepochs, the run time of each epoch, and the number of token types considered. All networks are\\nimplemented using Keras API of TensorFlow machine learning tool. The training is performed on\\nfour V100 GPUs, using Adam optimizer in data parallel mode with learning rate 1e-3, and batches of\\n512 samples. In each experiment, 20% of the samples are used for testing, while the rest are split in\\n4:1 for training and validation, respectively.\\nWe have experimented with several types of neural networks. Figure 5 shows the neural network\\nwe choose for the C++1400 benchmark. It is a multi-layer convolutional neural network. It uses\\ncategorical encoding of source code tokens. For batching, the sequences of tokens are padded with\\nzeros.\\nUsing this network we get a test accuracy 93.71±0.18% for C++1400 benchmark dataset, which is\\nsigniﬁcantly better than the accuracy shown by the bag-of-tokens approach. The neural networks\\nused for classiﬁcation of other benchmarks are similar to the one shown in Figure 5. As we see in\\nTable 9, their performance is similar.\\nC-BERT with Token Sequence\\nThe sequence-of-tokens representation can be used with other neural networks of increasing capacity.\\nWe build a C-BERT model (a transformer model introduced in [33]) by pre-training on 10,000 top\\nstarred GitHub open source projects written in C, where we use Clang C tokenizer and Sentencepiece\\nto tokenize the pre-training data. The C-BERT model is then ﬁne tuned on each classiﬁcation\\nbenchmark. Additionally, we experiment with the POJ-104 dataset, which contains code examples in\\nC and C++.\\nC-BERT achieves appealing results on binary classiﬁcation and vulnerability detection with C source\\ncode [10, 37]. However, it has not been used on multiclass classiﬁcation tasks or with other languages\\nsuch as C++, Java, and Python. Because we use sub-word tokenization and different programming\\nlanguages share common tokens, we could apply the C-BERT model directly on the benchmarks.\\nAfter pretraining, we ﬁne tune the model for ﬁve epochs on each benchmark, with a batch size 32 and\\nlearning rate 2e-5. The ﬁne-tuning was done on two V100 GPUs and it took 30 minutes to four hours,\\ndepending on the size of the dataset. The sub-word vocabulary size is 5,000. Contexts larger than\\n512 tokens were truncated.\\nTable 10 summarizes the accuracies C-BERT achives on the four CodeNet benchmarks as well as the\\nPOJ-104 dataset. C-BERT achieves high accuracy and performs the best on Java and Python.\\nTable 10: C-BERT results (accuracy, in %) for code classiﬁcation.\\nPOJ-104\\nC++1000\\nC++1400\\nJava250\\nPython800\\nC-BERT\\n98.41±0.01\\n93.79±0.01\\n91.83±0.06\\n97.40±0.19\\n97.09±0.18\\nThe relatively low performance on C++ benchmarks is possibly related to the idiosyncrasies of the\\ndataset and certain programming practices. Manual inspection suggests that lack of detailed variable\\nnames in C++ hurts the performance of the model, in problems appearing similar and having similar\\nsolutions. Removing one of the similar problems improves the model performance on the other\\nproblem. Moreover, one programming practice which could potentially confuse the models is that\\ncertain C++ users copied common constants (e.g., pi and epsilon) and data structures (e.g., enums) to\\nall solutions they submitted. In many cases, these duplicate contents were not even used.

The variant adds a virtual node to the graph\\nto enhance graph message passing [36]. We use the Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-3 for\\ntraining. All GNN models have ﬁve layers. We have experimented with more than 5 layers (i.e., 8\\nand 10), however deeper GNNs do not improve performance, as deeper GNNs might suffer from\\nthe over-smoothing problem (i.e., node features become less distinguishable after many rounds of\\nmessage passing) [38].\\nWe conduct 6/2/2 random split for each of the 4 benchmarks: i.e., 60% training data, 20% testing\\ndata, and 20% validation data. We run ﬁve folds for each benchmark with early stop ”patience”\\nset 20 (i.e., stop only when validation loss has not decreased in the past 20 epochs). Our model\\ntraining typically converges within 200 epochs in a 1-fold run. We modiﬁed OGB [39] code-base with\\nPyTorch Geometric [40] back-end over PyTorch 1.6.0 [41] to run our experiments. The experiments\\nare conducted on one NVIDIA V100 GPU. For large benchmarks such as C++1000 and C++1400, it\\ntakes about 1 week to ﬁnish a 5-fold run. We summarize model accuracy, training time over 5-folds,\\nand training epochs over 5-folds in Table 11. As we can see, adding a virtual node improves GNN\\nperformance (both GCN and GIN). Overall, GIN and its variants work better than GCN and its\\n12\\nvariants, likely due to the fact that GIN theoretically generalizes the Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism\\nTest and achieves maximum expressive power among GNNs [42].\\nFor the detailed model, hyper-parameter setup, data splits and etc, please refer to https://github.\\ncom/IBM/Project_CodeNet/tree/main/model-experiments/gnn-based-experiments.\\nTable 11: GNN (SPT) results for code classiﬁcation.

Note that textual similarity does not guarantee similarity in functionality.\\nFor example, programs that differ by only one token might behave very differently; hence, they are\\nnot considered similar. For the token-based experiments, we treat the problem as binary classiﬁcation.\\nWe use the same training, validation and testing split as in classiﬁcation. Code pairs are randomly\\nsampled within each subset. The number of similar pairs is the same as dissimilar ones. For the SPT\\nrepresentation, we experiment with several popular techniques, including AROMA [27], MISIM [21],\\nand GMN [44]. The following contains more details about the models and methods.\\n1. MLP with bag of tokens. This model is the same as the one for code classiﬁcation, except that\\nthe input is a concatenation of the two bag-of-tokens vectors from each program.\\n2. Siamese network with token sequence. The token sequence is the same as the one for code\\nclassiﬁcation. The model is a Siamese network with two CNNs with shared weights.\\n3. SPT with handcrafted feature extraction: The method AROMA [27] uses normalized SPT\\nnode names and handcrafted rules to extract feature vectors for each SPT. Then, similarity is\\ncomputed as a dot product of the extracted feature vectors.\\n4. GNN with SPT: With the same SPT, on the other hand, MISIM [21] uses a graph neural network\\nto extract high-level features, and uses the cosine similarity of the extracted features to compute\\nsimilarity. Additionally, we apply graph matching network (GMN) [44], which uses a cross-graph\\nattention mechanism to learn pair-wise structural similarity of graphs, on the SPT pairs to predict\\nsimilarity. The implementation is adapted from [45].\\nTable 12: Similarity accuracy (in %).\\nJava250\\nPython800\\nC++1000\\nC++1400\\nMLP w/ bag of tokens\\n81.80±0.06\\n86.61±0.08\\n85.82±0.05\\n86.54±0.07\\nSiamese w/ token sequence\\n89.70±0.18\\n94.67±0.12\\n96.19±0.08\\n96.56±0.07\\nTable 12 summarizes the classiﬁcation accuracy for the ﬁrst two models.

On the other hand, the Siamese model signiﬁcantly outperforms bag of tokens, as expected.\\nTable 13 summarizes the MAP@R [46] score for two SPT-based approaches with solutions for 50%\\nproblems used for training, 25% for validation, and 25% for test.

The\\nneural networks used for code similarity analysis on other benchmarks are similar to this one.

Obviously, the bag of\\ntokens is too primitive and misses many important details necessary for identifying similarity.\\nSiamese Network with Token Sequence\\nFor experiments on code similarity, we use the same sequence of tokens as for code classiﬁcation.\\nThe neural network has two inputs, one for each source code ﬁle. After experimenting with various\\nneural network architectures, we select the siamese network for its good performance.\\nTable 16 provides results of code similarity analysis on all four benchmarks. The columns give the\\nbenchmark name, the test accuracy, the number of training epochs, the number of samples in each\\nepoch, the run time of each epoch, the number of token types considered, and the number of test\\nsamples.

The\\ntraining is performed on four V100 GPUs, using Adam optimizer in data parallel mode with learning\\nrate 1e-3, and batches of 512 samples.\\nThe neural network for the C++1400 benchmark is depicted in Figure 8. The siamese parts of the\\nnetwork have the same structure and share all their weights. If the inputs are identical, so are the\\noutputs. Therefore, by construction, the network guarantees detecting similarity of identical source\\ncode samples. The outputs of the siamese parts are compared by computing the absolute difference.\\n15\\nTable 16: Similarity analysis by Siamese network with token sequence.\\nBenchmark\\nAccuracy\\nNumber\\nSize of\\nRun time\\nNumber\\nN test\\ndataset\\n%%\\nepochs\\nepoch\\nsec/epoch\\ntokens\\nsamples\\nJava250\\n89.70±0.18\\n29\\n51,200\\n114\\n75\\n512,000\\nPython800\\n94.67±0.12\\n110\\n64,000\\n89\\n71\\n512,000\\nC++1000\\n96.19±0.08\\n123\\n64,000\\n89\\n56\\n512,000\\nC++1400\\n96.56±0.07\\n144\\n64,000\\n96\\n56\\n512,000\\nThe network shows 96.56±0.07% test accuracy for C++1400 benchmark dataset. We consider this a\\ngood result, especially considering that the token sequence ignores all identiﬁers, comments, and\\nmany keywords. The neural networks used for code similarity analysis of other benchmarks are\\nsimilar to the one shown in Figure 8. As we see in Table 16, their accuracy is quite similar.\\nSPT-based experiments\\nFollowing MISIM [21], the train, validation, and test datasets for the SPT-based experiments draw\\nfrom entirely different problems. In our experiments, we use 50% problems for training, 25% for\\nvalidation, and 25% for test. The train, validation, and test split used for the experiments can be\\nfound at [47]. Similarity scores in Table 13 and Table 14 report mean and standard deviation of\\nMAP@R [46] values evaluated with models trained using ﬁve random seeds. The models are trained\\non a Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v4, 2.4GHz, 256 GiB memory using a NVIDIA V100 GPU. The SPTs\\nused in these experiments have nodes annotated with attributes derived by combining SPT features\\n(refer to Section 6), following the context-aware semantic structure (CASS) proposed in [21].\\nAROMA experiments are performed using the implementation of MISIM given in the further details\\nsection below [23] and the input (SPTs) used for these experiments can be found at [47]. Due to the\\nhigh memory requirement for computing MAP@R on the test set of CodeNet benchmarks, we had to\\nreduce the feature set of AROMA. We estimate that AROMA results can improve by 10–25% when\\nall features are used. AROMA is rule-based and no training is involved, hence we don’t report mean\\nand standard deviation in Table 13. For each of the four datasets – Java250, Python800, C++1000,\\nC++1400 – MISIM’s GNN model is trained for a total of 1000 epochs at a learning rate of 0.001\\nwith Adam optimizer. Each epoch consists of 1000 iterations, and in each iteration, 16 problems\\nand 5 solutions per problem are randomly sampled, and all solution pairs are used for training as in\\n[21]. MISIM results for the four languages can be reproduced by downloading the MISIM code and\\nscripts [23] and using the provided CASS ﬁles [47] as input.\\nFor the GMN experiments (row 2 and row 3 in Table 14), we adapt the implementation in [45] of\\nthe GMN model [44] using SPTs [47] as graphs. We follow the recommendations in [44] for the\\nmodel conﬁguration, as they produce the best and stable results in our experiments. Speciﬁcally,\\nwe use 5 layers of propagation with weight sharing across layers, dot-product similarity for the\\ncross-graph attention mechanism, and GRU layer to update node embeddings from the propagation\\nscheme. For GMN training, given the large set of SPT pairs, we adopt an approach similar to [21] of\\nrandomly sampling 16 problems with 5 solutions each. We use triplet loss with approximate hamming\\nsimilarity [44] for each sample, which is formed using a similar pair combined with a dissimilar SPT.\\nAfter every 100 iterations with a batch size of 64, another set of 16 problems and 5 solutions are\\nsampled randomly for a total of 150,000 iterations (1500 sampled sets). GMN results could improve\\nfurther with more training iterations. We use Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 for training.\\nThe ﬁrst two rows of Table 14 compare similarity models trained on SPT graph structure only.\\nThe ﬁrst row in the table adapts the MISIM GNN model by masking the node labels to allow the\\nmodel to learn structural features only. The second row uses the GMN [44] model with cross-graph\\nattention-based matching for structural similarity using a node vector dimension of 32 and graph\\nrepresentation dimension of 128.\\nFor the GMN+MISIM node attributes experiment, row 3 in Table 14, we allow the GMN model to\\nlearn features based on both node attributes and the SPT structure. Accordingly, we replace the node\\nencoder in the GMN, an MLP, with an embedding layer, for generating node feature vectors. We\\nexplore different node feature vector dimensions, such as 64, 100, 128, and found 100 to produce\\ngood results for the given number of training iterations. All other parameter settings remain the same\\nas the structure only GMN experiments from row 2 of Table 14. The GMN results can be reproduced\\nusing the Java250 CASS ﬁles available at [47].\\n16\\nwhile\\n(\\n{\\n)\\n==\\nGlobal Max Pooling\\nGlobal Max Pooling\\nDropout layer\\nDense layer 128x128 with ReLU\\nDense layer 128x128 with ReLU\\nDense layer 128x1\\nSigmoid\\n|x−y|\\nwhile\\n(\\n<\\n{\\n)\\nConvolution 5x160 with ReLU\\nConvolution 1x128\\nConvolution 15x256 with ReLU\\nFigure 8: Siamese architecture for similarity analysis.\\nMAP@R score [46] is computationally expensive for GMN models because an embedding has to be\\ncomputed for all SPT pairs in the test set, and hence Table 14 reports results on smaller sampled test\\nsets.\\nDetails of MLM Experiment\\nHere we show how a masked language model (MLM) can be trained with CodeNet. We closely\\nfollow the approach by Ankur Singh, documented in the blog [48]. The goal of the model is to infer\\nthe correct token for an arbitrary masked-out location in the source text. We assume that in every text,\\nprecisely one token is randomly masked. The original token at such position is then the golden label.\\nFrom each of the 1000 C++1000 problems, we randomly select 100 samples for training and another\\n100 for testing. Each C++ source ﬁle is tokenized into a vocabulary of 442 distinct tokens as\\ncategorized in Table 17. For example, while is a keyword and strlen is a function literal.\\nThis code snippet:\\n17\\nTable 17: Token categories used for MLM.\\nType\\nCount\\nDescription\\nthe keyword\\n95\\nall C++20 reserved words\\nthe function\\n280\\nfunction names in common header ﬁles\\nthe identiﬁer\\n42\\nstandard identiﬁers, like stderr, etc.\\nthe punctuator\\n16\\nsmall set of punctuation symbols\\n# or ##\\n2\\nthe C pre-processor symbols\\n0, 1\\n2\\nspecial case for these frequent constants\\nthe token class\\n5\\nidentiﬁer, number, operator, character, string\\nfor (i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++) {}\\nwill be tokenized to:\\nfor ( id = 0 ; id < strlen ( id ) ; id operator ) { }\\nThe tokenized source ﬁles are read into a pandas dataframe and processed by the Keras Text Vector-\\nization layer, to extract a vocabulary and encode all token lines into vocabulary indices, including the\\nspecial “[mask]” token. Each sample has a ﬁxed token length of 256. The average number of tokens\\nper sample across the training set is 474. Short samples are padded with 0 and those that are too large\\nare simply truncated.\\nThe model is trained with 100,000 samples in batches of 32 over ﬁve epochs, with a learning rate\\nof 0.001 using the Adam optimizer. We evaluate the trained model on a test set of 100,000 samples.\\nEach sample is pre-processed in the same way as the training samples and one token (never a padding)\\nis arbitrarily replaced by the “[mask]” symbol. Then, a prediction is generated and the top 1 and top\\n5 results are compared with the expected value. The achieved accuracies are top-1: 0.9104 (stddev:\\n0.002) and top-5: 0.9935 (stddev: 0.0005).\\n8.3\\nGeneralization Across Datasets\\nModels trained on the CodeNet benchmark datasets can beneﬁt greatly from their high quality. To\\ndemonstrate this, we compare C++1000 to one of the largest publicly available datasets of its kind,\\nGCJ-297 [23]. For the purpose of this comparison, we train the same MISIM model on C++1000 and\\nGCJ-297 and test the two trained models on a third, independent dataset - POJ-104. The result of this\\ncomparison is plotted in Figure 6.\\nThe x-axis of this plot is the number of training epochs used and the y-axis is the MAP@R score.\\nThe MISIM model for both datasets is trained for 500 epochs and the MAP@R score for validation\\nand test is computed after every ten epochs. There are a total of four curves - a validation and a test\\ncurve for GCJ-297 and a validation and a test curve for C++1000.\\nThe training curves show that a 10% higher validation score can be achieved with GCJ-297 compared\\nto C++1000. However, when tested on POJ-104, the model trained on GCJ-297 achieves a 12% lower\\nscore compared to the model trained on C++1000. We believe C++1000 has better generalization than\\nGCJ-297 mainly for two reasons: i) high data bias in GCJ-297 because the top 20 problems with the\\nmost number of submissions account for 50% of all submissions and ii) cleaning and de-duplication\\nof submissions in CodeNet dataset (as described in Section 5.2).\\n8.4\\nMasked Language Modelling for Token Inference\\nA task such as code completion relies on the ability to predict a token at a certain position in a\\nsequence. To accomplish this we can build a masked language model (MLM) using a technique that\\nrandomly masks out tokens in an input sequence and aims to correctly predict them in an as-yet-\\nunseen test set. We train a popular BERT-like attention model on the C++1000 CodeNet benchmark\\nafter tokenization to a vocabulary of over 400 tokens and obtain a top-1 prediction accuracy of 0.9104\\n(stddev: 0.002) and a top-5 accuracy of 0.9935 (stddev: 0.0005).\\n18\\n9\\nFurther Uses of CodeNet\\nThe rich metadata and language diversity open CodeNet to a plethora of use cases. The problem-\\nsubmission relationship in CodeNet corresponds to type-4 similarity [43] and can be used for code\\nsearch and clone detection. The code samples in CodeNet are labeled with their acceptance status\\nso we can readily extract pairs of buggy and ﬁxed code for code repair [49, 50]. A large number\\nof code samples come with inputs so that we can execute the code to extract the CPU run time and\\nmemory footprint, which can be used for regression studies and prediction.\\nCodeNet may also be used for program translation, given its wealth of programs written in a multitude\\nof languages. Translation between two programming languages is born out of a practical need to port\\nlegacy codebases to modern languages in order to increase accessibility and lower maintenance costs.\\nWith the help of neural networks, machine translation models developed for natural languages [51]\\nwere adapted to programming languages, producing pivotal success [4]. One considerable challenge of\\nneural machine translation is that model training depends on large, parallel corpora that are expensive\\nto curate [52], especially for low-resource languages (e.g., legacy code). Recently, monolingual\\napproaches [53, 4] were developed to mitigate the reliance on parallel data, paving ways to build\\nmodels for languages with little translation. Compared with current popular data sets (e.g., [4, 54]),\\nCodeNet covers a much richer set of languages with ample training instances.\\n10\\nConclusion\\nArtiﬁcial intelligence has made great strides in understanding human language. Computer scientists\\nhave been fascinated by the possibility and tantalized by the vision of computers (AI) programming\\ncomputers. In this paper, we presented \"CodeNet\", a ﬁrst-of-its-kind very large-scale, diverse and\\nhigh-quality dataset to accelerate the algorithmic advances in AI for Code. This dataset is not\\nonly unique in its scale, but also in the diversity of coding tasks it can help benchmark: from code\\nsimilarity and classiﬁcation for advances in code recommendation algorithms, and code translation\\nbetween a large variety of programming languages, to advances in code performance improvement\\ntechniques. We hope that the scale, diversity and rich, high-quality annotations of CodeNet will offer\\nunprecedented research opportunities at the intersection of AI and Software Engineering.\\n11\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe would like to acknowledge AIZU and AtCoder for making the code submissions publicly available.\\nWe would like to thank the IBM Data Asset eXchange team for providing a platform to host the\\nCodeNet dataset.

       "  'content': 'DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection\\nusing Probability Curvature\\nEric Mitchell 1 Yoonho Lee 1 Alexander Khazatsky 1 Christopher D. Manning 1 Chelsea Finn 1\\nAbstract\\nThe increasing fluency and widespread usage of\\nlarge language models (LLMs) highlight the de-\\nsirability of corresponding tools aiding detection\\nof LLM-generated text. In this paper, we identify\\na property of the structure of an LLM’s proba-\\nbility function that is useful for such detection.\\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that text sampled\\nfrom an LLM tends to occupy negative curva-\\nture regions of the model’s log probability func-\\ntion. Leveraging this observation, we then define\\na new curvature-based criterion for judging if a\\npassage is generated from a given LLM. This\\napproach, which we call DetectGPT, does not re-\\nquire training a separate classifier, collecting a\\ndataset of real or generated passages, or explic-\\nitly watermarking generated text. It uses only\\nlog probabilities computed by the model of in-\\nterest and random perturbations of the passage\\nfrom another generic pre-trained language model\\n(e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discrimi-\\nnative than existing zero-shot methods for model\\nsample detection, notably improving detection of\\nfake news articles generated by 20B parameter\\nGPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest\\nzero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for Detect-\\nGPT. See ericmitchell.ai/detectgpt\\nfor code, data, and other project information.\\n1. Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have proven able to gen-\\nerate remarkably fluent responses to a wide variety of user\\nqueries. Models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM\\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022), and ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022)\\ncan convincingly answer complex questions about science,\\nmathematics, historical and current events, and social trends.\\n1Stanford University.\\nCorrespondence to: Eric Mitchell\\n<eric.mitchell@cs.stanford.edu>.\\nProceedings of the 40 th International Conference on Machine\\nLearning, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

We aim to determine whether a piece of text was gener-\\nated by a particular LLM p, such as GPT-3. To classify a candidate\\npassage x, DetectGPT first generates minor perturbations of the\\npassage ˜xi using a generic pre-trained model such as T5. Then\\nDetectGPT compares the log probability under p of the original\\nsample x with each perturbed sample ˜xi. If the average log ratio\\nis high, the sample is likely from the source model.\\nWhile recent work has found that cogent-sounding LLM-\\ngenerated responses are often simply wrong (Lin et al.,\\n2022), the articulate nature of such generated text may still\\nmake LLMs attractive for replacing human labor in some\\ncontexts, notably student essay writing and journalism. At\\nleast one major news source has released AI-written content\\nwith limited human review, leading to substantial factual er-\\nrors in some articles (Christian, 2023). Such applications of\\nLLMs are problematic for a variety of reasons, making fair\\nstudent assessment difficult, impairing student learning, and\\nproliferating convincing-but-inaccurate news articles. Un-\\nfortunately, humans perform only slightly better than chance\\nwhen classifying machine-generated vs human-written text\\n(Gehrmann et al., 2019), leading researchers to consider\\nautomated detection methods that may identify signals dif-\\nficult for humans to recognize. Such methods might give\\nteachers and news-readers more confidence in the human\\norigin of the text that they consume.\\nAs in prior work (Jawahar et al., 2020), we study the\\n1\\narXiv:2301.11305v2  [cs.CL]  23 Jul 2023\\nZero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature\\nmachine-generated text detection problem as a binary clas-\\nsification problem. Specifically, we aim to classify whether\\na candidate passage was generated by a particular source\\nmodel. While several works have investigated methods for\\ntraining a second deep network to detect machine-generated\\ntext, such an approach has several shortcomings, including\\na tendency to overfit to the topics it was trained on as well as\\nthe need to train a new model for each new source model that\\nis released. We therefore consider the zero-shot version of\\nmachine-generated text detection, where we use the source\\nmodel itself, without fine-tuning or adaptation of any kind,\\nto detect its own samples. The most common method for\\nzero-shot machine-generated text detection is evaluating the\\naverage per-token log probability of the generated text and\\nthresholding (Solaiman et al., 2019; Gehrmann et al., 2019;\\nIppolito et al., 2020). However, this zeroth-order approach\\nto detection ignores the local structure of the learned proba-\\nbility function around a candidate passage, which we find\\ncontains useful information about the source of a passage.\\nThis paper poses a simple hypothesis: minor rewrites of\\nmodel-generated text tend to have lower log probability un-\\nder the model than the original sample, while minor rewrites\\nof human-written text may have higher or lower log prob-\\nability than the original sample. In other words, unlike\\nhuman-written text, model-generated text tends to lie in\\nareas where the log probability function has negative curva-\\nture (for example, near local maxima of the log probability).\\nWe empirically verify this hypothesis, and find that it holds\\ntrue across a diverse body of LLMs, even when the minor\\nrewrites, or perturbations, come from alternative language\\nmodels. We leverage this observation to build DetectGPT,\\na zero-shot method for automated machine-generated text\\ndetection. To test if a passage came from a source model pθ,\\nDetectGPT compares the log probability of the candidate\\npassage under pθ with the average log probability of several\\nperturbations of the passage under pθ (generated with, e.g.,\\nT5; Raffel et al. (2020)). If the perturbed passages tend\\nto have lower average log probability than the original by\\nsome margin, the candidate passage is likely to have come\\nfrom pθ. See Figure 1 for an overview of the problem and\\nDetectGPT. See Figure 2 for an illustration of the under-\\nlying hypothesis and Figure 3 for empirical evaluation of\\nthe hypothesis. Our experiments find that DetectGPT is\\nmore accurate than existing zero-shot methods for detect-\\ning machine-generated text, improving over the strongest\\nzero-shot baseline by over 0.1 AUROC for multiple source\\nmodels when detecting machine-generated news articles.\\nContributions. Our main contributions are: (a) the identi-\\nfication and empirical validation of the hypothesis that the\\ncurvature of a model’s log probability function tends to be\\nsignificantly more negative at model samples than for hu-\\nman text, and (b) DetectGPT, a practical algorithm inspired\\nby this hypothesis that approximates the trace of the log\\nlog pθ(x)\\nxfake ∼pθ (x)\\n˜x fake\\n1\\n˜x fake\\n2\\n˜x fake\\n3\\n˜x fake\\n4\\nxreal ∼phuman(x)\\n˜xreal\\n1\\n˜xreal\\n2\\n˜xreal\\n3\\n˜xreal\\n4\\nFake/real sample\\nPerturbed fake/real sample\\nLog likelihood\\n…\\nlog pθ(x)\\nFigure 2.

Related Work\\nIncreasingly large LLMs (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al.,\\n2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2022; Zhang et al.,\\n2022) have led to dramatically improved performance on\\nmany language-related benchmarks and the ability to gen-\\nerate convincing and on-topic text.\\nGROVER (Zellers\\net al., 2019) was the first LLM trained specifically for gen-\\nerating plausible news articles. Human evaluators found\\nGROVER-generated propaganda at least as trustworthy as\\nhuman-written propaganda, motivating the authors to study\\nGROVER’s ability to detect its own generations by fine-\\ntuning a detector on top of its features; they found GROVER\\nbetter able to detect GROVER-generated text than other pre-\\ntrained models. However, Bakhtin et al. (2019); Uchendu\\net al. (2020) note that models trained explicitly to detect\\nmachine-generated text tend to overfit to their training dis-\\ntribution of data or source models.\\nOther works have trained supervised models for machine-\\ngenerated text detection on top of neural representations\\n(Bakhtin et al., 2019; Solaiman et al., 2019; Uchendu et al.,\\n2020; Ippolito et al., 2020; Fagni et al., 2021), bag-of-words\\nfeatures (Solaiman et al., 2019; Fagni et al., 2021), and hand-\\ncrafted statistical features (Gehrmann et al., 2019). Alterna-\\ntively, Solaiman et al. (2019) notes the surprising efficacy\\nof a simple zero-shot method for machine-generated text\\ndetection, which thresholds a candidate passage based on its\\naverage log probability under the generative model, serving\\nas a strong baseline for zero-shot machine-generated text\\ndetection in our work. In our work, we similarly use the\\ngenerating model to detect its own generations in a zero shot\\nmanner, but through a different approach based on estimat-\\ning local curvature of the log probability around the sample\\nrather than the raw log probability of the sample itself. See\\nJawahar et al. (2020) for a complete survey on machine-\\n2\\nZero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature\\ngenerated text detection. Other work explores watermarks\\nfor generated text (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023), which modify\\na model’s generations to make them easier to detect. Our\\nwork does not assume text is generated with the goal of easy\\ndetection; DetectGPT detects text generated from publicly\\navailable LLMs using standard LLM sampling strategies.\\nThe widespread use of LLMs has led to much other con-\\ntemporaneous work on detecting LLM output. Sadasivan\\net al. (2023) show that the detection AUROC of the an de-\\ntector is upper bounded by a function of the TV distance\\nbetween the model and human text. However, we find that\\nAUROC of DetectGPT is high even for the largest publicly-\\navailable models (Table 2), suggesting that TV distance may\\nnot correlate strongly with model scale and capability. This\\ndisconnect may be exacerbated by new training objectives\\nother than maximum likelihood, e.g., reinforcement learn-\\ning with human feedback (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler\\net al., 2020). Both Sadasivan et al. (2023) and Krishna et al.\\n(2023) show the effectiveness of paraphrasing as a tool for\\nevading detection, suggesting an important area of study\\nfor future work. Liang et al. (2023) show that multi-lingual\\ndetection is difficult, with non-DetectGPT detectors show-\\ning bias against non-native speakers; this result highlights\\nthe advantage of zero-shot detectors like DetectGPT, which\\ngeneralize well to any data generated by the original gener-\\nating model. Mireshghallah et al. (2023) study which proxy\\nscoring models produce the most useful log probabilities\\nfor detection when the generating model is not known (a\\nlarge-scale version of our Figure 6). Surprisingly (but con-\\nsistent with our findings), they find that smaller models are\\nin fact better proxy models for performing detection with\\nperturbation-based methods like DetectGPT.\\nThe problem of machine-generated text detection echoes ear-\\nlier work on detecting deepfakes, artificial images or videos\\ngenerated by deep nets, which has spawned substantial ef-\\nforts in detection of fake visual content (Dolhansky et al.,\\n2020; Zi et al., 2020). While early works in deepfake de-\\ntection used relatively general-purpose model architectures\\n(G¨uera & Delp, 2018), many deepfake detection methods\\nrely on the continuous nature of image data to achieve state-\\nof-the-art performance (Zhao et al., 2021; Guarnera et al.,\\n2020), making direct application to text difficult.\\n3. The Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text\\nDetection Problem\\nWe study zero-shot machine-generated text detection, the\\nproblem of detecting whether a piece of text, or candidate\\npassage x, is a sample from a source model pθ. The problem\\nis zero-shot in the sense that we do not assume access to\\nhuman-written or generated samples to perform detection.\\nAs in prior work, we study a ‘white box’ setting (Gehrmann\\net al., 2019) in which the detector may evaluate the log prob-\\nAlgorithm 1 DetectGPT model-generated text detection\\n1: Input: passage x, source model pθ, perturbation function q,\\nnumber of perturbations k, decision threshold ϵ\\n2: ˜xi ∼q(· | x), i ∈[1..k] // mask spans, sample replacements\\n3: ˜µ ←1\\nk\\nP\\ni log pθ(˜xi)\\n// approximate expectation in Eq. 1\\n4: ˆdx ←log pθ(x) −˜µ\\n// estimate d (x, pθ, q)\\n5: ˜σ2\\nx ←\\n1\\nk−1\\nP\\ni (log pθ(˜xi) −˜µ)2 // variance for normalization\\n6: if\\nˆdx\\n√˜σx > ϵ then\\n7:\\nreturn true\\n// probably model sample\\n8: else\\n9:\\nreturn false\\n// probably not model sample\\nability of a sample log pθ(x). The white box setting does\\nnot assume access to the model architecture or parameters.\\nMost public APIs for LLMs (such as GPT-3) enable scoring\\ntext, though some exceptions exist, notably ChatGPT. While\\nmost of our experiments consider the white box setting, see\\nSection 5.2 for experiments in which we score text using\\nmodels other than the source model. See Mireshghallah\\net al. (2023) for a comprehensive evaluation in this setting.\\nThe detection criterion we propose, DetectGPT, also makes\\nuse of generic pre-trained mask-filling models in order to\\ngenerate passages that are ‘nearby’ the candidate passage.\\nHowever, these mask-filling models are used off-the-shelf,\\nwithout any fine-tuning or adaptation to the target domain.\\n4. DetectGPT: Zero-shot Machine-Generated\\nText Detection with Random Perturbations\\nDetectGPT is based on the hypothesis that samples from a\\nsource model pθ typically lie in areas of negative curvature\\nof the log probability function of pθ, unlike human text. In\\nother words, if we apply small perturbations to a passage\\nx ∼pθ, producing ˜x, the quantity log pθ(x) −log pθ(˜x)\\nshould be relatively large on average for machine-generated\\nsamples compared to human-written text. To leverage this\\nhypothesis, first consider a perturbation function q(· | x)\\nthat gives a distribution over ˜x, slightly modified versions of\\nx with similar meaning (we will generally consider roughly\\nparagraph-length texts x). As an example, q(· | x) might be\\nthe result of simply asking a human to rewrite one of the\\nsentences of x, while preserving the meaning of x. Using\\nthe notion of a perturbation function, we can define the\\nperturbation discrepancy d (x, pθ, q):\\nd (x, pθ, q) ≜log pθ(x) −E˜x∼q(·|x) log pθ(˜x)\\n(1)\\nWe state our hypothesis more formally as the Local Pertur-\\nbation Discrepancy Gap Hypothesis, which describes a gap\\nin the perturbation discrepancy for model-generated text\\nand human-generated text.\\nPerturbation Discrepancy Gap Hypothesis. If q produces\\nsamples on the data manifold, d (x, pθ, q) is positive and\\nlarge with high probability for samples x ∼pθ. For human-\\nwritten text, d (x, pθ, q) tends toward zero for all x.\\n3\\nZero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\ngpt2-xl\\nHuman\\nModel\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\nEleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nEleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\nEleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nLog Probability Change (Perturbation Discrepancy)\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nFrequency\\nFigure 3.

Each plot\\nshows the distribution of the perturbation discrepancy d (x, pθ, q)\\nfor human-written news articles and machine-generated arti-\\ncles of equal word length. Human-written articles are a sample\\nof 500 XSum articles; machine-generated text, generated from\\nmodels GPT-2 (1.5B), GPT-Neo-2.7B (Black et al., 2021), GPT-J\\n(6B; Wang & Komatsuzaki (2021)) and GPT-NeoX (20B; Black\\net al. (2022)), is generated by prompting each model with the first\\n30 tokens of each XSum article, sampling from the raw conditional\\ndistribution. Discrepancies are estimated with 100 T5-3B samples.\\nIf we define q(· | x) to be samples from a mask-filling model\\nsuch as T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), rather than human rewrites,\\nwe can empirically test the Perturbation Discrepancy Gap\\nHypothesis in an automated, scalable manner. For real data,\\nwe use 500 news articles from the XSum dataset (Narayan\\net al., 2018); for model samples, we use the output of four\\ndifferent LLMs when prompted with the first 30 tokens of\\neach article in XSum. We use T5-3B to apply perturbations,\\nmasking out randomly-sampled 2-word spans until 15% of\\nthe words in the article are masked. We approximate the\\nexpectation in Eq. 1 with 100 samples from T5.1 Figure 3\\nshows the result of this experiment. We find the distribution\\nof perturbation discrepancies is significantly different for\\nhuman-written articles and model samples; model samples\\ntend to have a larger perturbation discrepancy. Section 5.3\\nexplores a relaxation of the assumption that q only produces\\nsamples on the data manifold, finding that a gap, although\\nreduced, still exists in this case.\\nGiven these results, we can detect if a piece of text was\\ngenerated by a model pθ by simply thresholding the pertur-\\nbation discrepancy. In practice, we find that normalizing the\\nperturbation discrepancy by the standard deviation of the ob-\\nserved values used to estimate E˜x∼q(·|x) log pθ(˜x) provides\\na slightly better signal for detection, typically increasing\\n1We later show in Figure 8 that varying the number of samples\\nused to estimate the expectation effectively allows for trading off\\nbetween accuracy and speed.\\nAUROC by around 0.020, so we use this normalized version\\nof the perturbation discrepancy in our experiments. The\\nresulting method, DetectGPT, is summarized in Alg. 1. Hav-\\ning described an application of the perturbation discrepancy\\nto machine-generated text detection, we next provide an\\ninterpretation of this quantity.\\nInterpretation of perturbation discrepancy as curvature\\nWhile Figure 3 suggests that the perturbation discrepancy\\nmay be useful, it is not immediately obvious what it mea-\\nsures. In this section, we show that the perturbation dis-\\ncrepancy approximates a measure of the local curvature\\nof the log probability function near the candidate passage,\\nmore specifically, that it is proportional to the negative trace\\nof the Hessian of the log probability function.2 To han-\\ndle the non-differentiability of discrete data, we consider\\ncandidate passages in a latent semantic space, where small\\ndisplacements correspond to valid edits that retain similar\\nmeaning to the original. Because our perturbation function\\n(T5) models natural text, we expect our perturbations to\\nroughly capture such meaningful variations of the original\\npassage, rather than arbitrary edits.\\nWe first invoke Hutchinson’s trace estimator (Hutchinson,\\n1990), giving an unbiased estimate of the trace of matrix A:\\ntr(A) = Ezz⊤Az\\n(2)\\nprovided that the elements of z ∼qz are IID with E[zi] = 0\\nand Var(zi) = 1. To use Equation 2 to estimate the trace\\nof the Hessian of f at x, we must therefore compute the\\nexpectation of the directional second derivative z⊤Hf(x)z.\\nWe approximate this expression with finite differences:\\nz⊤Hf(x)z ≈f(x + hz) + f(x −hz) −2f(x)\\nh2\\n(3)\\nCombining Equations 2 and 3 and simplifying with h = 1,\\nwe have an estimate of the negative Hessian trace\\n−tr (Hf(x)) ≈2f(x) −Ez [f(x + z) + f(x −z)] . (4)\\nIf our noise distribution is symmetric, that is, p(z) = p(−z)\\nfor all z, then we can simplify Equation 4 to\\n−tr (Hf(x))\\n2\\n≈f(x) −Ezf(x + z).\\n(5)\\nWe note that the RHS of Equation 5 corresponds to the\\nperturbation discrepancy (1) where the perturbation func-\\ntion q(˜x | x) is replaced by the distribution qz(z) used\\nin Hutchinson’s trace estimator (2). Here, ˜x is a high-\\ndimensional sequence of tokens while qz is a vector in a\\n2Rather than the Hessian of the log likelihood with respect to\\nmodel parameters (the Fisher Information Matrix), here we refer\\nto the Hessian of the log probability with respect to the sample x.\\n4\\nZero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature\\nXSum\\nSQuAD\\nWritingPrompts\\nMethod\\nGPT-2 OPT-2.7 Neo-2.7 GPT-J NeoX\\nAvg.\\nGPT-2 OPT-2.7 Neo-2.7 GPT-J NeoX\\nAvg.\\nGPT-2 OPT-2.7 Neo-2.7 GPT-J NeoX\\nAvg.\\nlog p(x)\\n0.86\\n0.86\\n0.86\\n0.82\\n0.77\\n0.83\\n0.91\\n0.88\\n0.84\\n0.78\\n0.71\\n0.82\\n0.97\\n0.95\\n0.95\\n0.94\\n0.93*\\n0.95\\nRank\\n0.79\\n0.76\\n0.77\\n0.75\\n0.73\\n0.76\\n0.83\\n0.82\\n0.80\\n0.79\\n0.74\\n0.80\\n0.87\\n0.83\\n0.82\\n0.83\\n0.81\\n0.83\\nLogRank\\n0.89*\\n0.88*\\n0.90*\\n0.86*\\n0.81*\\n0.87*\\n0.94*\\n0.92*\\n0.90*\\n0.83*\\n0.76*\\n0.87*\\n0.98*\\n0.96*\\n0.97*\\n0.96*\\n0.95\\n0.96*\\nEntropy\\n0.60\\n0.50\\n0.58\\n0.58\\n0.61\\n0.57\\n0.58\\n0.53\\n0.58\\n0.58\\n0.59\\n0.57\\n0.37\\n0.42\\n0.34\\n0.36\\n0.39\\n0.38\\nDetectGPT\\n0.99\\n0.97\\n0.99\\n0.97\\n0.95\\n0.97\\n0.99\\n0.97\\n0.97\\n0.90\\n0.79\\n0.92\\n0.99\\n0.99\\n0.99\\n0.97\\n0.93*\\n0.97\\nDiff\\n0.10\\n0.09\\n0.09\\n0.11\\n0.14\\n0.10\\n0.05\\n0.05\\n0.07\\n0.07\\n0.03\\n0.05\\n0.01\\n0.03\\n0.02\\n0.01\\n-0.02\\n0.01\\nTable 1.

Since the mask-filling model sam-\\nples sentences similar to x with minimal changes to seman-\\ntic meaning, we can think of the mask-filling model as first\\nsampling a similar semantic embedding (˜z ∼qz) and then\\nmapping this to a token sequence (˜z 7→˜x). Sampling in\\nsemantic space ensures that all samples stay near the data\\nmanifold, which is useful because we would expect the log\\nprobability to always drop if we randomly perturb tokens.\\nWe can therefore interpret our objective as approximating\\nthe curvature restricted to the data manifold.\\n5. Experiments\\nWe conduct experiments to better understand multiple facets\\nof machine-generated text detection; we study the effective-\\nness of DetectGPT for zero-shot machine-generated text de-\\ntection compared to prior zero-shot approaches, the impact\\nof distribution shift on zero-shot and supervised detectors,\\nand detection accuracy for the largest publicly-available\\nmodels. To further characterize factors that impact detec-\\ntion accuracy, we also study the robustness of zero-shot\\nmethods to machine-generated text that has been partially\\nrevised, the impact of alternative decoding strategies on\\ndetection accuracy, and a black-box variant of the detec-\\ntion task. Finally, we analyze more closely DetectGPT’s\\nbehavior as the choice of perturbation function, the number\\nof samples used to estimate d (x, pθ, q), the length of the\\npassage, and the data distribution is varied.\\nComparisons. We compare DetectGPT with various exist-\\ning zero-shot methods for machine-generated text detection\\nthat also leverage the predicted token-wise conditional dis-\\ntributions of the source model for detection. These methods\\ncorrespond to statistical tests based on token log probabil-\\nities, token ranks, or predictive entropy (Gehrmann et al.,\\n2019; Solaiman et al., 2019; Ippolito et al., 2020). The\\nfirst method uses the source model’s average token-wise log\\nprobability to determine if a candidate passage is machine-\\ngenerated or not; passages with high average log probability\\nare likely to be generated by the model. The second and\\nthird methods use the average observed rank or log-rank of\\nthe tokens in the candidate passage according to the model’s\\nconditional distributions. Passages with smaller average\\n(log-)rank are likely machine-generated. We also evalu-\\nate an entropy-based approach inspired by the hypothesis\\nin Gehrmann et al. (2019) that model-generated texts will\\nbe more ‘in-distribution’ for the model, leading to more\\nover-confident (thus lower entropy) predictive distributions.\\nEmpirically, we find predictive entropy to be positively cor-\\nrelated with passage fake-ness more often that not; there-\\nfore, this baseline uses high average entropy in the model’s\\npredictive distribution as a signal that a passage is machine-\\ngenerated. While our main focus is on zero-shot detectors\\nas they do not require re-training for new domains or source\\nmodels, for completeness we perform comparisons to su-\\npervised detection models in Section 5.1, using OpenAI’s\\nRoBERTa-based (Liu et al., 2019) GPT-2 detector models,3\\nwhich are fine-tuned on millions of samples from various\\nGPT-2 model sizes and decoding strategies.\\nDatasets & metrics Our experiments use six datasets that\\ncover a variety of everyday domains and LLM use-cases.\\nWe use news articles from the XSum dataset (Narayan et al.,\\n2018) to represent fake news detection, Wikipedia para-\\ngraphs from SQuAD contexts (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) to\\nrepresent machine-written academic essays, and prompted\\nstories from the Reddit WritingPrompts dataset (Fan et al.,\\n2018) to represent detecting machine-generated creative\\nwriting submissions. To evaluate robustness to distribution\\nshift, we also use the English and German splits of WMT16\\n(Bojar et al., 2016) as well as long-form answers written by\\nhuman experts in the PubMedQA dataset (Jin et al., 2019).\\nEach experiment uses between 150 and 500 examples for\\nevaluation, as noted in the text. For each experiment, we\\ngenerate the machine-generated text by prompting with the\\nfirst 30 tokens of the real text (or just the question tokens\\nfor the PubMedQA experiments). We measure performance\\nusing the area under the receiver operating characteristic\\ncurve (AUROC), which can be interpreted as the probability\\nthat a classifier correctly ranks a randomly-selected posi-\\ntive (machine-generated) example higher than a randomly-\\nselected negative (human-written) example. All experiments\\nuse an equal number of positive and negative examples.\\n3https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-\\ndataset/tree/master/detector\\n5\\nZero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature\\nRoB-base\\nRoB-lg\\nLikelihood\\nRank\\nLogRank\\nDetectGPT\\n(Ours)\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n0.981\\n0.997\\n0.889\\n0.800\\n0.915\\n0.991\\nXSum GPT-2 Detection\\nRoB-base\\nRoB-lg\\nLikelihood\\nRank\\nLogRank\\nDetectGPT\\n(Ours)\\n0.888\\n0.946\\n0.838\\n0.795\\n0.863\\n0.957\\nWMT16-en mGPT Detection\\nRoB-base\\nRoB-lg\\nLikelihood\\nRank\\nLogRank\\nDetectGPT\\n(Ours)\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n0.604\\n0.713\\n0.768\\n0.664\\n0.773\\n0.836\\nPubMedQA PubMedGPT Detection\\nSupervised\\nUnsupervised\\nRoB-base\\nRoB-lg\\nLikelihood\\nRank\\nLogRank\\nDetectGPT\\n(Ours)\\n0.394\\n0.537\\n0.795\\n0.838\\n0.861\\n0.962\\nWMT16-de mGPT Detection\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nDetection Method\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nDetection AUROC\\nFigure 4.

For these domains, supervised detectors\\nfail due to excessive distribution shift.\\nHyperparameters. The key hyperparameters of DetectGPT\\nare the fraction of words masked for perturbation, the length\\nof the masked spans, the model used for mask filling, and the\\nsampling hyperparameters for the mask-filling model. Using\\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) masked language modeling as\\ninspiration, we use 15% as the mask rate. We performed\\na small sweep over masked span lengths of {2, 5, 10} on a\\nheld-out set of XSum data, finding 2 to perform best. We\\nuse these settings for all experiments, without re-tuning.\\nWe use T5-3B for almost all experiments, except for GPT-\\nNeoX and GPT-3 experiments, where compute resources\\nallowed for the larger T5-11B model; we also use mT5-3B\\ninstead of T5-3B for the WMT multilingual experiment.

DetectGPT detects generations from GPT-3 and Jurassic-2\\nJumbo (175B models from OpenAI and AI21 Labs) with average\\nAUROC on-par with supervised models trained specifically for\\nmachine-generated text detection. For more ‘typical’ text, such\\nas news articles, supervised methods perform strongly. The GPT-\\n3 AUROC appears first in each column, the Jurassic-2 AUROC\\nappears second (i.e., after the slash).\\nand the average margin of improvement is narrow.4 For 14\\nof the 15 combinations of dataset and model, DetectGPT\\nprovides the most accurate detection performance, with a\\n0.06 AUROC improvement on average. Log-rank threshold-\\ning proves to be a consistently stronger baseline than log\\nprobability thresholding, although it requires slightly more\\ninformation (full predicted logits), which are not always\\navailable in public APIs.\\nComparison with supervised detectors. While our experi-\\nments generally focus on zero-shot detection, some works\\nhave evaluated the detection performance of supervised\\nmethods (typically fine-tuned transformers) for detecting\\nmachine-generated text. In this section, we explore several\\ndomains to better understand the relative strengths of super-\\nvised and zero-shot detectors. The results are presented in\\nFigure 4, using 200 samples from each dataset for evalua-\\ntion. We find that supervised detectors can provide similar\\ndetection performance to DetectGPT on in-distribution data\\nlike English news, but perform significantly worse than zero-\\nshot methods in the case of English scientific writing and\\nfail altogether for German writing. This finding echoes past\\nwork showing that language models trained for machine-\\ngenerated text detection overfit to their training data (source\\nmodel, decoding strategy, topic, language, etc.; Uchendu\\net al. (2020); Ippolito et al. (2020); Jawahar et al. (2020)).\\nIn contrast, zero-shot methods generalize relatively easily\\nto new languages and domains; DetectGPT’s performance\\nin particular is mostly unaffected by the change in language\\nfrom English to German.\\nWhile our experiments have shown that DetectGPT is ef-\\nfective on a variety of domains and models, it is natural to\\nwonder if it is effective for the largest publicly-available\\nLMs. Therefore, we also evaluate multiple zero-shot and su-\\npervised methods on two 175B parameter models, OpenAI’s\\nGPT-3 and AI21 Labs’ Jurassic-2 Jumbo. Because neither\\nAPI provides access to the complete conditional distribution\\n4The overall ease of detecting machine-generated fake writing\\ncorroborates anecdotal reporting that machine-generated creative\\nwriting tends to be noticeably generic, and therefore relatively easy\\nto detect (Roose & Newton, 2022).\\n6\\nZero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature\\n0.00\\n0.08\\n0.16\\n0.04\\n0.12\\n0.24\\n0.20\\nFraction of GPT-J-generated news article re-written\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\nDetection AUROC\\nRank\\nDetectGPT\\nLogRank\\nLikelihood\\nEntropy\\nFigure 5.

We show in Table 2 that DetectGPT can provide\\ndetection competitive with or better than the stronger of the\\ntwo supervised models, and it again greatly outperforms\\nprobability thresholding on average.\\n5.2. Variants of Machine-Generated Text Detection\\nDetecting paraphrased machine-generated text. In prac-\\ntice, humans may manually edit or refine machine-generated\\ntext rather than blindly use a model’s generations for their\\ntask of interest. We therefore conduct an experiment to\\nsimulate the detection problem for model samples that have\\nbeen increasingly heavily revised. We simulate human re-\\nvision by replacing 5 word spans of the text with samples\\nfrom T5-3B until r% of the text has been replaced, and\\nreport performance as r varies. Figure 5 shows that De-\\ntectGPT maintains detection AUROC above 0.8 even when\\nnearly a quarter of the text in model samples has been re-\\nplaced. Unsurprisingly, almost all methods show a gradual\\ndegradation in performance as the sample is more heavily\\nrevised. The entropy baseline shows surprisingly robust\\nperformance in this setting (althought it is least accurate\\non average), even slightly improving detection performance\\nup to 24% replacement.

Other factors impacting performance of DetectGPT\\nIn this section, we explore how factors such as the size of the\\nmask-filling model, the number of perturbations used to es-\\ntimate the expectation in Equation 1, or the data distribution\\nof the text to be detected impact detection quality.\\nSource and mask-filling model scale. Here we study the\\nimpact of the size of the source model and mask-filling\\nmodel on DetectGPT’s performance; the results are shown\\nin Figure 7. In particular, the increased discrimination power\\nof DetectGPT for larger mask-filling models supports the\\ninterpretation that DetectGPT is estimating the curvature\\nof the log probability in a latent semantic space, rather\\nthan in raw token embedding space. Larger T5 models\\nbetter represent this latent space, where random directions\\ncorrespond to meaningful changes in the text.\\nNumber of perturbations for DetectGPT.

Figure 9 shows the perturbation discrepancy dis-\\ntributions for model-generated and human texts across four\\ndata distributions, using GPT-Neo-2.7B to generate sam-\\nples. A threshold of slightly below 0.1 separates human and\\nmodel texts across data distributions, which is important for\\npractical scenarios in which a passage may be analyzed with-\\nout knowing its domain a priori. Finally, Figure 10 shows an\\nanalysis of DetectGPT’s performance as a function of pas-\\nsage length. We bin the paired human- and model-generated\\nsequences by their average length into three bins of equal\\nsize (bottom/middle/top third), and plot the AUROC within\\neach bin. The relationship between detection performance\\nand passage length generally depends on the dataset and\\nmodel (or tokenizer). For very long sequences, DetectGPT\\nmay see reduced performance because our implementation\\nof DetectGPT applies all T5 mask-filling perturbations at\\nonce, and T5 may fail to track many mask tokens at once.\\nBy applying perturbations in multiple sequential rounds of\\nsmaller numbers of masks, this effect may be mitigated.\\n6. Discussion\\nAs large language models continue to improve, they will\\nbecome increasingly attractive tools for replacing human\\nwriters in a variety of contexts, such as education, jour-\\nnalism, and art. While legitimate uses of language model\\ntechnologies exist in all of these settings, teachers, readers,\\nand consumers are likely to demand tools for verifying the\\nhuman origin of certain content with high educational, so-\\ncietal, or artistic significance, particularly when factuality\\n(and not just fluency) is crucial.\\nIn light of these elevated stakes and the regular emergence of\\nnew large language models, we study the zero-shot machine-\\ngenerated text detection problem, in which we use only the\\nraw log probabilities computed by a generative model to\\ndetermine if a candidate passage was sampled from it.

Our experiments find that\\nthis signal is more discriminative than existing zero-shot\\ndetection methods and is competitive with bespoke detection\\nmodels trained with millions of model samples.\\nDetectGPT and Watermarking. One interpretation of\\nthe perturbation function is producing semantically similar\\nrephrasings of the original passage. If these rephrasings\\nare systematically lower-probability than the original pas-\\nsage, the model is exposing its bias toward the specific (and\\nroughly arbitrary, by human standards) phrasing used. In\\nother words, LLMs that do not perfectly imitate human\\nwriting essentially watermark themselves implicitly. Under\\nthis interpretation, efforts to manually add watermarking bi-\\nases to model outputs (Aaronson, 2022; Kirchenbauer et al.,\\n2023) may further improve the effectiveness of methods\\nsuch as DetectGPT, even as LLMs continue to improve.\\nLimitations. One limitation of probability-based methods\\nfor zero-shot machine-generated text detection (like Detect-\\nGPT) is the white-box assumption that we can evaluate log\\nprobabilities of the model(s) in question. For models be-\\nhind APIs that do provide probabilities (such as GPT-3),\\nevaluating probabilities nonetheless costs money. Another\\nassumption of DetectGPT is access to a reasonable pertur-\\nbation function. While in this work, we use off-the-shelf\\nmask-filling models such as T5 and mT5 (for non-English\\nlanguages), some domains may see reduced performance\\nif existing mask-filling models do not well represent the\\nspace of meaningful rephrases, reducing the quality of the\\ncurvature estimate. While DetectGPT provides the best\\navailable detection performance for PubMedQA, its drop\\nin performance compared to other datasets may be a result\\nAverage length\\n0.985\\n0.990\\n0.995\\nAUROC\\ngpt-2\\nAverage length\\n0.96\\n0.97\\n0.98\\n0.99\\nAUROC\\nopt-2.7\\nXSum\\nSQuAD\\nWritingPrompts\\n130\\n140\\n150\\n160\\n170\\nAverage length\\n0.875\\n0.900\\n0.925\\n0.950\\n0.975\\nAUROC\\nEleutherAI/gpt-j-6b\\n130\\n140\\n150\\n160\\n170\\nAverage length\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\nAUROC\\nEleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b\\nFigure 10. DetectGPT AUROC vs passage length. The relation-\\nship between detection performance and passage length generally\\ndepends on the dataset and model (or tokenizer). Decreases in\\ndetection quality with increasing length may be due to T5 failing\\nto track many (20+) masks to fill at once; this problem may be\\nmitigated by applying mask-fills in a sequence of smaller batches.\\nof lower quality perturbations. Finally, DetectGPT is more\\ncompute-intensive than other methods for detection, as it\\nrequires sampling and scoring the set of perturbations for\\neach candidate passage, rather than just the candidate pas-\\nsage; a better tuned perturbation function or more efficient\\ncurvature approximation may help mitigate these costs.\\nFuture Work. While the methods in this work make no\\nassumptions about the models generating the samples, fu-\\nture work may explore how watermarking algorithms can be\\nused in conjunction with detection algorithms like Detect-\\nGPT to further improve detection robustness as language\\nmodels continually improve their reproductions of human\\ntext. Separately, the results in Section 5.2 suggest that ex-\\ntending DetectGPT to use ensembles of models for scoring,\\nrather than a single model, may improve detection in the\\nblack box setting. Another topic that remains unexplored\\nis the relationship between prompting and detection; that\\nis, can a clever prompt successfully prevent a model’s gen-\\nerations from being detected by existing methods? Finally,\\nfuture work may explore whether the local log probabil-\\nity curvature property we identify is present for generative\\nmodels in other domains, such as audio, video, or images.\\nWe hope that the present work serves as inspiration to fu-\\nture work developing effective, general-purpose methods\\nfor mitigating potential harms of machine-generated media.\\nAcknowledgements\\nEM gratefully acknowledges funding from a Knight-\\nHennessy Graduate Fellowship.

       "  'content': 'DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller,\\nfaster, cheaper and lighter\\nVictor SANH, Lysandre DEBUT, Julien CHAUMOND, Thomas WOLF\\nHugging Face\\n{victor,lysandre,julien,thomas}@huggingface.co\\nAbstract\\nAs Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent\\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-\\nedge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains\\nchallenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-\\npurpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be ﬁne-\\ntuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts.\\nWhile most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-speciﬁc\\nmodels, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show\\nthat it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97%\\nof its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the\\ninductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple\\nloss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our\\nsmaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its\\ncapabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a\\ncomparative on-device study.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nFigure 1: Parameter counts of several recently released\\npretrained language models.\\nThe last two years have seen the rise\\nof Transfer Learning approaches in\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\\nwith large-scale pre-trained language\\nmodels becoming a basic tool in\\nmany NLP tasks [Devlin et al., 2018,\\nRadford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019].\\nWhile these models lead to signiﬁ-\\ncant improvement, they often have\\nseveral hundred million parameters\\nand current research1 on pre-trained\\nmodels indicates that training even\\nlarger models still leads to better per-\\nformances on downstream tasks.\\nThe trend toward bigger models\\nraises several concerns. First is the\\nenvironmental cost of exponentially scaling these models’ computational requirements as mentioned\\nin Schwartz et al. [2019], Strubell et al. [2019]. Second, while operating these models on-device\\nin real-time has the potential to enable novel and interesting language processing applications, the\\ngrowing computational and memory requirements of these models may hamper wide adoption.\\n1See for instance the recently released MegatronLM (https://nv-adlr.github.io/MegatronLM)\\nEMC^2: 5th Edition Co-located with NeurIPS’19\\narXiv:1910.01108v4  [cs.CL]  1 Mar 2020\\nIn this paper, we show that it is possible to reach similar performances on many downstream-tasks\\nusing much smaller language models pre-trained with knowledge distillation, resulting in models\\nthat are lighter and faster at inference time, while also requiring a smaller computational training\\nbudget. Our general-purpose pre-trained models can be ﬁne-tuned with good performances on several\\ndownstream tasks, keeping the ﬂexibility of larger models. We also show that our compressed models\\nare small enough to run on the edge, e.g. on mobile devices.\\nUsing a triple loss, we show that a 40% smaller Transformer (Vaswani et al. [2017]) pre-trained\\nthrough distillation via the supervision of a bigger Transformer language model can achieve similar\\nperformance on a variety of downstream tasks, while being 60% faster at inference time. Further\\nablation studies indicate that all the components of the triple loss are important for best performances.\\nWe have made the trained weights available along with the training code in the Transformers2\\nlibrary from HuggingFace [Wolf et al., 2019].\\n2\\nKnowledge distillation\\nKnowledge distillation [Bucila et al., 2006, Hinton et al., 2015] is a compression technique in which\\na compact model - the student - is trained to reproduce the behaviour of a larger model - the teacher -\\nor an ensemble of models.\\nIn supervised learning, a classiﬁcation model is generally trained to predict an instance class by\\nmaximizing the estimated probability of gold labels. A standard training objective thus involves\\nminimizing the cross-entropy between the model’s predicted distribution and the one-hot empirical\\ndistribution of training labels. A model performing well on the training set will predict an output\\ndistribution with high probability on the correct class and with near-zero probabilities on other\\nclasses. But some of these \"near-zero\" probabilities are larger than others and reﬂect, in part, the\\ngeneralization capabilities of the model and how well it will perform on the test set3.\\nTraining loss The student is trained with a distillation loss over the soft target probabilities of\\nthe teacher: Lce = P\\ni ti ∗log(si) where ti (resp. si) is a probability estimated by the teacher\\n(resp. the student). This objective results in a rich training signal by leveraging the full teacher\\ndistribution. Following Hinton et al. [2015] we used a softmax-temperature: pi =\\nexp(zi/T )\\nP\\nj exp(zj/T )\\nwhere T controls the smoothness of the output distribution and zi is the model score for the class i.\\nThe same temperature T is applied to the student and the teacher at training time, while at inference,\\nT is set to 1 to recover a standard softmax.\\nThe ﬁnal training objective is a linear combination of the distillation loss Lce with the supervised\\ntraining loss, in our case the masked language modeling loss Lmlm [Devlin et al., 2018]. We found it\\nbeneﬁcial to add a cosine embedding loss (Lcos) which will tend to align the directions of the student\\nand teacher hidden states vectors.\\n3\\nDistilBERT: a distilled version of BERT\\nStudent architecture In the present work, the student - DistilBERT - has the same general architec-\\nture as BERT. The token-type embeddings and the pooler are removed while the number of layers\\nis reduced by a factor of 2. Most of the operations used in the Transformer architecture (linear\\nlayer and layer normalisation) are highly optimized in modern linear algebra frameworks and our\\ninvestigations showed that variations on the last dimension of the tensor (hidden size dimension) have\\na smaller impact on computation efﬁciency (for a ﬁxed parameters budget) than variations on other\\nfactors like the number of layers. Thus we focus on reducing the number of layers.\\nStudent initialization In addition to the previously described optimization and architectural choices,\\nan important element in our training procedure is to ﬁnd the right initialization for the sub-network to\\nconverge. Taking advantage of the common dimensionality between teacher and student networks,\\nwe initialize the student from the teacher by taking one layer out of two.\\n2https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\\n3E.g.\\nBERT-base’s predictions for a masked token in \"I think this is the beginning of a\\nbeautiful [MASK]\" comprise two high probability tokens (day and life) and a long tail of valid predictions\\n(future, story, world...).\\n2\\nTable 1: DistilBERT retains 97% of BERT performance.

DistilBERT\\nwas trained on 8 16GB V100 GPUs for approximately 90 hours. For the sake of comparison, the\\nRoBERTa model [Liu et al., 2019] required 1 day of training on 1024 32GB V100.\\n4\\nExperiments\\nGeneral Language Understanding We assess the language understanding and generalization ca-\\npabilities of DistilBERT on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark\\n[Wang et al., 2018], a collection of 9 datasets for evaluating natural language understanding systems.\\nWe report scores on the development sets for each task by ﬁne-tuning DistilBERT without the use\\nof ensembling or multi-tasking scheme for ﬁne-tuning (which are mostly orthogonal to the present\\nwork). We compare the results to the baseline provided by the authors of GLUE: an ELMo (Peters\\net al. [2018]) encoder followed by two BiLSTMs.4\\nThe results on each of the 9 tasks are showed on Table 1 along with the macro-score (average of\\nindividual scores). Among the 9 tasks, DistilBERT is always on par or improving over the ELMo\\nbaseline (up to 19 points of accuracy on STS-B). DistilBERT also compares surprisingly well to\\nBERT, retaining 97% of the performance with 40% fewer parameters.\\n4.1\\nDownstream task benchmark\\nDownstream tasks We further study the performances of DistilBERT on several downstream tasks\\nunder efﬁcient inference constraints: a classiﬁcation task (IMDb sentiment classiﬁcation - Maas et al.\\n[2011]) and a question answering task (SQuAD v1.1 - Rajpurkar et al. [2016]).\\nAs shown in Table 2, DistilBERT is only 0.6% point behind BERT in test accuracy on the IMDb\\nbenchmark while being 40% smaller. On SQuAD, DistilBERT is within 3.9 points of the full BERT.\\nWe also studied whether we could add another step of distillation during the adaptation phase by\\nﬁne-tuning DistilBERT on SQuAD using a BERT model previously ﬁne-tuned on SQuAD as a\\n4We use jiant [Wang et al., 2019] to compute the baseline.\\n3\\nTable 4: Ablation study.

In this setting, there are thus two\\nsuccessive steps of distillation, one during the pre-training phase and one during the adaptation phase.\\nIn this case, we were able to reach interesting performances given the size of the model: 79.8 F1 and\\n70.4 EM, i.e. within 3 points of the full model.\\nSize and inference speed\\nTo further investigate the speed-up/size trade-off of DistilBERT, we compare (in Table 3) the number\\nof parameters of each model along with the inference time needed to do a full pass on the STS-\\nB development set on CPU (Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 Haswell @2.9GHz) using a batch size of 1.\\nDistilBERT has 40% fewer parameters than BERT and is 60% faster than BERT.\\nOn device computation We studied whether DistilBERT could be used for on-the-edge applications\\nby building a mobile application for question answering. We compare the average inference time on\\na recent smartphone (iPhone 7 Plus) against our previously trained question answering model based\\non BERT-base. Excluding the tokenization step, DistilBERT is 71% faster than BERT, and the whole\\nmodel weighs 207 MB (which could be further reduced with quantization). Our code is available5.\\n4.2\\nAblation study\\nIn this section, we investigate the inﬂuence of various components of the triple loss and the student\\ninitialization on the performances of the distilled model. We report the macro-score on GLUE.

In the present work, we found it beneﬁcial to use a general-purpose\\npre-training distillation rather than a task-speciﬁc distillation. Turc et al. [2019] use the original\\npretraining objective to train smaller student, then ﬁne-tuned via distillation. As shown in the abla-\\ntion study, we found it beneﬁcial to leverage the teacher’s knowledge to pre-train with additional\\ndistillation signal.\\nMulti-distillation Yang et al.

An\\napplication of multi-distillation is multi-linguality: Tsai et al. [2019] adopts a similar approach to us\\nby pre-training a multilingual model from scratch solely through distillation.

It is an attempt to open-source a 100B-scale\\nmodel at least as good as GPT-3 (davinci) and unveil how models of such a scale\\ncan be successfully pre-trained. Over the course of this effort, we face numer-\\nous unexpected technical and engineering challenges, particularly on loss spikes\\nand divergence. In this paper, we introduce the training process of GLM-130B\\nincluding its design choices, training strategies for both efficiency and stabil-\\nity, and engineering efforts. The resultant GLM-130B model offers significant\\noutperformance over GPT-3 175B (davinci) on a wide range of popular English\\nbenchmarks while the performance advantage is not observed in OPT-175B and\\nBLOOM-176B. It also consistently and significantly outperforms ERNIE TITAN\\n3.0 260B—the largest Chinese language model—across related benchmarks. Fi-\\nnally, we leverage a unique scaling property of GLM-130B to reach INT4 quanti-\\nzation without post training, with almost no performance loss, making it the first\\namong 100B-scale models and more importantly, allowing its effective inference\\non 4×RTX 3090 (24G) or 8×RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs, the most affordable\\nGPUs required for using 100B-scale models. The GLM-130B model weights are\\npublicly accessible and its code, training logs, related toolkit, and lessons learned\\nare open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B/.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nLarge language models (LLMs), particularly those with over 100 billion (100B) parameters (Brown\\net al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021),\\nhave presented attractive scaling laws (Wei et al., 2022b), where emergent zero-shot and few-shot\\ncapabilities suddenly arose. Among them, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with 175B parameters pi-\\noneers the study of 100B-scale LLMs by strikingly generating better performance with 32 labeled\\nexamples than the fully-supervised BERT-Large model on a variety of benchmarks. However, both\\nGPT-3 (and many other closed-sourced 100B-scale ones)—the model itself—and how it can be\\ntrained, have been thus far intransparent to the public. It is of critical value to train a high-quality\\nLLM of such scale with both the model and training process shared with everyone.\\nWe thus aim to pre-train an open and highly-accurate 100B-scale model with ethical concerns in\\nmind. Over the course of our attempt, we have come to realize that pre-training a dense LLM at\\nsuch a scale raises numerous unexpected technical and engineering challenges compared to training\\n10B-scale models, in terms of pre-training efficiency, stability, and convergence. Similar difficulties\\nhave also been concurrently observed in training OPT-175B (Zhang et al., 2022) and BLOOM-\\n176B (Scao et al., 2022), further demonstrating the significance of GPT-3 as a pioneer study.\\n*The two lead authors AZ and XL contributed equally ({zengaohan,shawliu9}@gmail.com)\\n†Work partially done when AZ, XL, and ZD interned at Zhipu.AI.\\n‡Team leads: YD and JT.

As it has been widely realized that it is computationally unaffordable to\\nempirically enumerate all possible designs for training 100B-scale LLMs, we present not only the\\nsuccessful part for training GLM-130B but also many of the failed options and lessons learned.\\nParticularly, the training stability is the decisive factor in the success of training models of such a\\nscale. Different from practices such as manually adjusting learning rates in OPT-175B and using\\nembedding norm in the sacrifice of performance in BLOOM-176B, we experiment with various op-\\ntions and find the strategy of embedding gradient shrink can significantly stabilize the training of\\nGLM-130B.\\nSpecifically, GLM-130B is a bilingual (English and Chinese) bidirectional dense model with 130 bil-\\nlion parameters, pre-trained over 400 billion tokens on a cluster of 96 NVIDIA DGX-A100 (8×40G)\\nGPU nodes between May 6 and July 3, 2022. Instead of using the GPT-style architecture, we adopt\\nthe General Language Model (GLM) algorithm (Du et al., 2022) to leverage its bidirectional at-\\ntention advantage and autoregressive blank infilling objective. Table 1 summarizes the comparison\\nbetween GLM-130B, GPT-3 and another two open-source efforts—OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B,\\nas well as PaLM 540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)—a 4× larger model—as a reference.\\nAltogether, the conceptual uniqueness and engineering efforts enable GLM-130B to exhibit perfor-\\nmance that surpasses the level of GPT-3 on a wide range of benchmarks (in total 112 tasks) and also\\noutperforms PaLM 540B in many cases, while outperformance over GPT-3 has not been observed in\\nOPT-175B and BLOOM-176B (Cf. Figure 1 left). For zero-shot performance, GLM-130B is better\\nthan GPT-3 175B (+5.0%), OPT-175B (+6.5%), and BLOOM-176B (+13.0%) on LAMBADA (Pa-\\nperno et al., 2016), and achieves 3× better performance than GPT-3 on Big-bench-lite (Srivastava\\net al., 2022). For the 5-shot MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) tasks, it is better than GPT-3 175B\\n(+0.9%) and BLOOM-176B (+12.7%). As a bilingual LLM also in Chinese, it offers significantly\\nbetter results than ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B (Wang et al., 2021)—the largest Chinese LLM—on 7\\nzero-shot CLUE (Xu et al., 2020) datasets (+24.26%) and 5 zero-shot FewCLUE (Xu et al., 2021)\\nones (+12.75%). Importantly, as summarized in Figure 1 right, GLM-130B as an open model is\\nassociated with significantly less bias and generation toxicity than its 100B-scale counterparts.\\nFinally, we design GLM-130B to empower as many people as possible to conduct 100B-scale LLM\\nstudies. First, instead of using 175B+ parameters as OPT and BLOOM, the 130B size is decided be-\\ncause such a size supports inference on a single A100 (8×40G) server. Second, to further lower the\\nGPU requirements, we quantize GLM-130B into INT4 precision without post training while OPT\\nand BLOOM can only reach INT8. Due to a unique property of the GLM architecture, GLM-130B’s\\nINT4 quantization introduces negligible performance degradation, e.g., -0.74% on LAMBADA and\\neven +0.05% on MMLU, making it still better than the uncompressed GPT-3. This enables GLM-\\n130B’s fast inference with performance guarantee on a server of 4×RTX 3090 (24G) or 8×RTX\\n2080 Ti (11G), the most affordable GPU required for using 100B-scale LLMs to date.\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nGradient Norm\\n(a) More than 30 failed preliminary trials at 100B-scale (b) Final decisive trials: Sandwich-LN v.s.

However, it has been real-\\nized that it is computationally unaffordable to explore various architectural designs for LLMs. We\\nintroduce and explain the unique design choices of GLM-130B.\\n2.1\\nGLM-130B’S ARCHITECTURE\\nGLM as Backbone. Most recent 100B-scale LLMs, such as GPT-3, PaLM, OPT, and BLOOM,\\nfollow the traditional GPT-style (Radford et al., 2019) architecture of decoder-only autoregressive\\nlanguage modeling. In GLM-130B, we instead make an attempt to explore the potential of a bidi-\\nrectional GLM—General Language Model (Du et al., 2022)—as its backbone.\\nGLM is a transformer-based language model that leverages autoregressive blank infilling as its train-\\ning objective. Briefly, for a text sequence x = [x1, · · · , xn], text spans {s1, · · · , sm} are sampled\\nfrom it, each of which si denotes a span of consecutive tokens [si,1, · · · , si,li] and is replaced (i.e.,\\ncorrupted) with a single mask token to form xcorrupt. The model is asked to recover them autoregres-\\nsively. To allow interactions between corrupted spans, their visibility to each other is decided by a\\nrandomly sampled permutation on their order.\\nGLM’s bidirectional attention over unmasked (i.e., uncorrupted) contexts distinguishes GLM-130B\\nfrom GPT-style LLMs in which the unidirectional attention is used. To support both understanding\\nand generation, it mixes two corruption objectives, each indicated by a special mask token:\\n• [MASK]: short blanks in sentences whose lengths add up to a certain portion of the input.\\n• [gMASK]: random-length long blanks at the end of sentences with prefix contexts provided.\\nBidirec\\'onal A.en\\'on\\n(e.g., GLM)\\nUnidirec\\'onal A.en\\'on\\n(e.g., GPT-3, PaLM)\\nContext\\nMask(s)\\nFigure 2: GLM-130B and LLMs of similar\\nscale on zero-shot LAMBADA language\\nmodeling. Details on GLM’s bidirectional\\nattention are provided in Du et al. (2022).\\nConceptually, the blank infilling objective with bidi-\\nrectional attention enables a more effective compre-\\nhension of contexts than GPT-style models: when us-\\ning [MASK], GLM-130B behaves as BERT (Devlin\\net al., 2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020); when us-\\ning [gMASK], GLM-130B behaves similarly to Pre-\\nfixLM (Liu et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019).\\nEmpirically, GLM-130B offers a record-high accuracy\\nof 80.2% on zero-shot LAMBADA by outperforming\\nboth GPT-3 and PaLM 540B in Figure 2. By setting\\nthe attention mask, GLM-130B’s unidirectional vari-\\nant is comparable to GPT-3 and OPT-175B. Our ob-\\nservations are in line with existing findings (Liu et al.,\\n2018; Dong et al., 2019).\\nLayer Normalization (LN, Ba et al. (2016)). Training instability is one major challenge for training\\nLLMs (Zhang et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022) (Cf. Figure 10 in Appendix\\nfor collapses in training several 100B-scale models). A proper choice of LNs can help stabilize\\nthe training of LLMs. We experiment with existing practices, e.g., Pre-LN (Xiong et al., 2020),\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nPost-LN (Ba et al., 2016), Sandwich-LN (Ding et al., 2021), which are unfortunately incapable of\\nstabilizing our GLM-130B test runs (Cf. Figure 3 (a) and Appendix B.2 for details).\\nOur search is later focused on Post-LN due to its favorable downstream results in preliminary ex-\\nperiments though it does not stabilize GLM-130B. Fortunately, one of the attempts on Post-LN\\ninitialized with the newly-proposed DeepNorm (Wang et al., 2022b) generates promising training\\nstability. Specifically, given the number of GLM-130B’s layers N, we adopt DeepNorm(x) =\\nLayerNorm(α · x + Network(x)), where α = (2N)\\n1\\n2 , and apply the Xavier normal initialization\\nwith the scaling factor of (2N)−1\\n2 to ffn, v_proj and out_proj. Additionally, all bias terms\\nare initialized to zero. Figure 3 shows it significantly benefits the training stability of GLM-130B.\\nPositional Encoding and FFNs. We empirically test different options for positional encoding (PE)\\nand FFN improvements in terms of both training stability and downstream performance (Cf. Ap-\\npendix B.3 for details). For PEs in GLM-130B, we adopt Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE, Su\\net al. (2021)) rather than ALiBi (Press et al., 2021). To improve FFNs in Transformer, we pick GLU\\nwith the GeLU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) activation as the replacement.\\n2.2\\nGLM-130B’S PRE-TRAINING SETUP\\nInspired by recent works (Aribandi et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022), the GLM-130B\\npre-training objective includes not only the self-supervised GLM autoregressive blank infilling) but\\nalso multi-task learning for a small portion of tokens. This is expected to help boost its downstream\\nzero-shot performance.\\nSelf-Supervised Blank Infilling (95% tokens). Recall that GLM-130B uses both [MASK] and\\n[gMASK] for this task. Each training sequence is applied with one of them independently at a time.\\nSpecifically, [MASK] is used to mask consecutive spans in 30% of training sequences for blank\\ninfilling. The lengths of spans follow a Poisson distribution (λ = 3) and add up to 15% of the input.\\nFor the other 70% sequences, the prefix of each sequence is kept as context and [gMASK] is used\\nto mask the rest of it. The masked length is sampled from the Uniform distribution.\\nThe pre-training data includes 1.2T Pile (train split) (Gao et al., 2020) English, 1.0T Chinese Wudao-\\nCorpora (Yuan et al., 2021), and 250G Chinese corpora (including online forums, encyclopedia, and\\nQA) we crawl from the web, which form a balanced composition of English and Chinese contents.\\nMulti-Task Instruction Pre-Training (MIP, 5% tokens).\\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and\\nExT5 (Aribandi et al., 2022) suggest that multi-task learning in pre-training can be more helpful\\nthan fine-tuning, we thus propose to include a variety of instruction prompted datasets including\\nlanguage understanding, generation, and information extraction in GLM-130B’s pre-training.\\nCompared to recent works (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022) that leverage multi-task prompted\\nfine-tuning to improve zero-shot task transfer, MIP only accounts for 5% tokens and is set in the pre-\\ntraining stage to prevent spoiling LLMs’ other general ability, e.g., unconditional free generation.\\nSpecifically, we include 74 prompted datasets from (Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a), listed\\nin Appendix C and Table 12. GLM-130B users are suggested to avoid evaluating its zero-shot and\\nfew-shot capabilities on these datasets according to the criterion illustrated in Section 5.\\n2.3\\nPLATFORM-AWARE PARALLEL STRATEGIES AND MODEL CONFIGURATIONS\\nGLM-130B is trained on a cluster of 96 DGX-A100 GPU (8×40G) servers with a 60-day access.\\nThe goal is to pass through as many tokens as possible, as a recent study (Hoffmann et al., 2022)\\nsuggests that most existing LLMs are largely under-trained.\\nThe 3D Parallel Strategy.\\nThe data parallelism (Valiant, 1990) and tensor model paral-\\nlelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019) are the de facto practices for training billion-scale models (Wang &\\nKomatsuzaki, 2021; Du et al., 2022). To further handle the huge GPU memory requirement and the\\ndecrease in overall GPU utilization resulted from applying tensor parallel between nodes—as 40G\\nrather than 80G A100s are used for training GLM-130B, we combine the pipeline model parallelism\\nwith the other two strategies to form a 3D parallel strategy.\\nThe pipeline parallelism divides the model into sequential stages for each parallel group, and to fur-\\nther minimize bubbles introduced by pipeline, we leverage the PipeDream-Flush (Narayanan et al.,\\n2021) implementation from DeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) to train GLM-130B with a relative\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nbig global batch size (4,224) to reduce time and GPU memory wasting. Through both numeri-\\ncal and empirical examinations, we adopt 4-way tensor parallelism and 8-way pipeline parallelism\\n(Cf. Appendix B.4 for details). Following the calculation in (Chowdhery et al., 2022), we report\\nhardware FLOPs utilization (HFU) of 43.3% and model FLOPs utilization (MFU) of 32.5% due to\\nre-materialization.\\nGLM-130B Configurations. We aim to enable our 100B-scale LLM to run a single DGX-A100\\n(40G) node in FP16 precision. Based on the hidden state dimension of 12,288 we adopt from\\nGPT-3, the resultant model size has to be no more than 130B parameters, thus GLM-130B. To\\nmaximize GPU utilization, we configure the model based on the platform and its corresponding\\nparallel strategy. To avoid insufficient memory utilization in the middle stages due to the additional\\nword embedding at both ends, we balance the pipeline partition by removing one layer from them,\\nmaking 9×8-2=70 transformer layers in GLM-130B.\\nDuring the 60-day access to the cluster, we manage to train GLM-130B for 400 billion tokens\\n(roughly 200 billion each for Chinese and English) with a fixed sequence length of 2,048 per sample.\\nFor the [gMASK] training objective, we use a context window of 2,048 tokens. For the [MASK]\\nand multi-task objectives, we use a context window of 512 and concatenate four samples together to\\ncater the 2,048-sequence-length. We warm-up the batch size from 192 to 4224 over the first 2.5%\\nsamples. We use AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) as our optimizer with β1 and β2 set to 0.9\\nand 0.95, and a weight decay value of 0.1. We warm up the learning rate from 10−7 to 8 × 10−5\\nover the first 0.5% samples, then decay it by a 10× cosine schedule. We use a dropout rate of 0.1\\nand clip gradients using a clipping value of 1.0 (Cf. Table 11 for the full configurations).\\n3\\nTHE TRAINING STABILITY OF GLM-130B\\nThe training stability is the decisive factor in GLM-130B’s quality, which is also largely impacted\\nby the number of tokens it passes through (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Thus, given the computing\\nusage constraint, there has to be a trade-off between efficiency and stability with regard to floating-\\npoint (FP) formats: low-precision FP formats (e.g., 16-bit precision—FP16) improve computing\\nefficiency but are prone to overflow and underflow errors, resulting in training collapses.\\n(a) Gradient norm with EGS α = 0.1\\n(b) EGS in 40B-scale testing\\nFigure 4: EGS reduces gradi-\\nent scale and variance to stabi-\\nlize LLMs’ pre-training.\\nMixed-Precision. We follow the common practice of a mixed-\\nprecision (Micikevicius et al., 2018) strategy (Apex O2), i.e., FP16\\nfor forwards and backwards and FP32 for optimizer states and mas-\\nter weights, to reduce the GPU memory usage and improve train-\\ning efficiency. Similar to OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B (C.f. Fig-\\nure 10 in Appendix), the training of GLM-130B faces frequent loss\\nspikes resulted from this choice, which tends to become increas-\\ningly frequent as the training goes on. The precision related spikes\\nare often without clear reasons: some recover on their own; others\\ncome with a portent of suddenly soaring gradient norm and even-\\ntually a spike or even NaN in loss. OPT-175B attempted to fix by\\nmanually skipping data and adjusting hyper-parameters; BLOOM-\\n176B did so via the embedding norm technique (Dettmers et al.,\\n2021). We spent months to empirically investigate the spikes and\\nrealize that a few issues emerge when transformers scale up:\\nFirst, the transformer main branch’s value scale can be extremely\\nlarge in deeper layers if using Pre-LN. This is addressed in GLM-\\n130B by using DeepNorm based Post-LN (Cf. Section 2.1), which\\nmakes the value scale always bounded.\\nSecond, the attention scores grow so large that they exceed FP16’s\\nrange, as the model scales up.\\nThere are a few options to overcome this issue in LLMs.\\nIn\\nCogView (Ding et al., 2021), PB-Relax is proposed to remove bias terms and deduct extremum\\nvalue in attention computation to avoid the problem, which unfortunately does not help avoid dis-\\nconvergence in GLM-130B. In BLOOM-176B, the BF16 format is used instead of FP16, due to its\\nwide range of values on NVIDIA Ampere GPUs (i.e., A100). However, BF16 consumes ∼15%\\nmore run-time GPU memory than FP16 in our experiments due to its conversion to FP32 in gradi-\\n5\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nent accumulation, and more importantly it is not supported on other GPU platforms (e.g., NVIDIA\\nTesla V100), limiting the accessibility of produced LLMs. Another option from BLOOM-176B is\\nto apply embedding norm with BF16, but in sacrifice of a significant penalty on model performance,\\nas they notice that embedding norm can harm model’s zero-shot learning (Cf. Section 4.3 in (Scao\\net al., 2022)).\\nEmbedding Layer Gradient Shrink (EGS). Our empirical search identifies that the gradient norm\\ncan serve as an informative indicator of training collapses. Specifically, we find that a training\\ncollapse usually lags behind a “spike” in gradient norm by a few training steps. Such spikes are\\nusually caused by the embedding layer’s abnormal gradients, as we observe that its gradient norm\\nis often several magnitude larger that those of other layers in GLM-130B’s early stage training (Cf.\\nFigure 4 (a)). In addition, it tends to fluctuate dramatically in the early training. The problem is\\nhandled in vision models (Chen et al., 2021) via freezing the patch projection layer. Unfortunately,\\nwe cannot freeze the training of the embedding layer in language models.\\nFinally, we find the gradient shrink on embedding layers could overcome loss spikes and thus sta-\\nbilize GLM-130B’s training. It is first used in the multi-modal transformer CogView (Ding et al.,\\n2021). Let α be the shrinking factor, the strategy can be easily implemented via word_embedding =\\nword_embedding ∗α +word_embedding.detach()∗(1−α). Figure 4 (b) suggests that empirically,\\nsetting α = 0.1 wipes out most spikes we would have met, with negligible latency.\\nIn fact, the final GLM-130B training run only experiences three late-stage loss divergence cases,\\nthough it fails numerous times due to hardware failures. For the three unexpected spikes, it turns out\\nfurther shrinking the embedding gradient can still help stabilize the GLM-130B training. See the\\ntraining notes and Tensorboard logs in our code repository for details.\\n4\\nGLM-130B INFERENCE ON RTX 2080 TI\\nOne of the major goals of GLM-130B is to lower the hardware requirements for accessing 100B-\\nscale LLMs without efficiency and effectiveness disadvantages.\\nAs mentioned, the model size of 130B is determined for running the full GLM-130B model on a sin-\\ngle A100 (40G×8) server, rather than the high-end A100 (80G×8) machine required by OPT-175B\\nand BLOOM-176B. To accelerate GLM-130B inference, we also leverage FasterTransformer (Ti-\\nmonin et al., 2022) to implement GLM-130B in C++. Compared to the PyTorch implementation\\nof BLOOM-176B in Huggingface, GLM-130B’s decoding inference is 7-8.4× faster on the same\\nsingle A100 server. (Cf. Appendix B.5 for details).\\nINT4 Quantization for RTX 3090s/2080s. To further support popularized GPUs, we attempt to\\ncompress GLM-130B as much as possible while maintaining performance superiority, particularly\\nvia quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Tao et al., 2022), which introduces little\\ntask-agnostic performance drops for generative language models.\\nFigure 5: (Left) attn-dense and w2’s\\nweight distributions; (Right) GLM-130B’s\\nINT4 weight quantization scaling law.\\nTypically, the practice is to quantize both model\\nweights and activations to INT8. However, our anal-\\nysis in Appendix B.6 suggests that LLMs’ activations\\nmay contain extreme outliers. Concurrently, the emer-\\ngent outliers in OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B are\\nalso discovered (Dettmers et al., 2022), which influ-\\nence only about 0.1% feature dimensions and are thus\\nsolved by matrix multiplication decomposition for the\\noutlying dimensions.\\nDifferently, there exist about\\n30% outliers in GLM-130B’s activations, making the\\ntechnique above far less efficient. Thus, we decide\\nto focus on the quantization of model weights (i.e.,\\nmostly linear layers) while keeping the FP16 precision\\nfor activations. The quantized model is dynamically converted to FP16 precision at runtime, in-\\ntroducing a small computational overhead but greatly reducing the GPU memory usage for storing\\nmodel weights.\\n6\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nTable 2: Left: Quantized GLM-130B’s performance on several benchmarks; Right: INT4 quantized\\nGLM-130B’s inference speed (encode and decode) with FasterTransformer.\\nModel Precision\\nGLM-130B\\nGPT-3\\nFP16\\nINT8 INT4\\nFP16\\nMMLU (acc, ↑)\\n44.75 44.71 44.80\\n43.9\\nLAMBADA (acc, ↑) 80.21 80.21 79.47\\n76.2\\nPile (a part, BPB, ↓) 0.634 0.638 0.641\\n0.74\\nGPU Type\\n128 Enc./Dec. 512 Enc./Dec,\\n8 × A100 (40G)\\n0.15s\\n4.29s\\n0.18s\\n17.7s\\n8 × V100 (32G)\\n0.31s\\n6.97s\\n0.67s\\n28.1s\\n4 × RTX 3090 (24G)\\n0.37s\\n8.16s\\n1.30s\\n32.3s\\n8 × RTX 2080 Ti (11G) 0.39s\\n6.77s\\n1.04s\\n27.3s\\nExcitingly, we manage to reach the INT4 weight quantization for GLM-130B while existing suc-\\ncesses have thus far only come to the INT8. Memory-wise, by comparing to INT8, the INT4 version\\nhelps additionally save half of the required GPU memory to 70GB, thus allowing GLM-130B infer-\\nence on 4 × RTX 3090 Ti (24G) or 8 × RTX 2080 Ti (11G). Performance-wise, Table 2 left indicates\\nthat without post-training at all, the INT4-version GLM-130B experiences almost no performance\\ndegradation, thus maintaining the performance advantages over GPT-3 on common benchmarks.\\nGLM’s INT4 Weight Quantization Scaling Law. We examine the underlying mechanism of this\\nunique INT4 weight quantization scaling law exhibited in Figure 5 right. We plot the weight value\\ndistributions in Figure 5 left, which turns out to directly impact the quantization quality. Specifically,\\na wider-distributed linear layer needs to be quantized with larger bins, leading to more precision loss.\\nThus the wide-distributed attn-dense and w2 matrices explain the INT4 quantization failure for\\nGPT-style BLOOM. Conversely, GLMs tend to have much narrower distributions than those of\\nsimilar-sized GPTs, and the gap between INT4 and FP16 versions keeps further decreasing as the\\nGLM model size scales up (Cf. Figure 15 in Appendix for details).\\n5\\nTHE RESULTS\\nWe follow the common settings in LLMs such as GPT-3 and PaLM to evaluate GLM-130B for\\nEnglish 1. As a bilingual LLM with Chinese, GLM-130B is also evaluated on Chinese benchmarks.\\nDiscussion on the Scope of Zero-Shot Learning in GLM-130B. Since GLM-130B has been\\ntrained with MIP, here we clarify its scope of zero-shot evaluation. In fact, “zero-shot” seems to\\nhave controversial interpretations without a consensus in the community. We follow one of the in-\\nfluential related surveys (Xian et al., 2018), which says “At test time, in zero-shot learning setting,\\nthe aim is to assign a test image to an unseen class label” where involving unseen class labels is a\\nkey. Therefore, we derive our criterion to pick GLM-130B’s zero-shot (and few-shot) datasets as:\\n• English: 1) For tasks with fixed labels (e.g., natural language inference): no datasets in such tasks\\nshould be evaluated on; 2) For tasks without fixed labels (e.g., (multiple-choice) QA, topic classi-\\nfication): only datasets with an obvious domain transfer from those in MIP should be considered.\\n• Chinese: All datasets can be evaluated as there exists a zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.\\nFiltering Test Datasets. Following prior practices (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021) and our\\ncriterion mentioned above, we filter and refrain to report potentially contaminated datasets’ evalua-\\ntion results. For LAMBADA and CLUE, we find minimal overlap under the 13-gram setting. Pile,\\nMMLU, and BIG-bench are either held-out or released later than the crawling of corpora.\\n5.1\\nLANGUAGE MODELING\\nLAMBADA. LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016) is a dataset to test the last word language model-\\ning capability. The results previously shown in Figure 2 suggest GLM-130B achieves a zero-shot\\naccuracy of 80.2 with its bidirectional attention, setting up a new record on LAMBADA.\\nTable 3: GLM-130B’s average BPB on\\nPile evaluation (18 sub-datasets).\\nJurassic-1 GPT-3 GLM-130B\\nAvg.

It is\\nreleased after the crawling of Pile and serves as an ideal test-bed for LLMs’ few-shot learning. The\\nGPT-3 result is adopted from MMLU and BLOOM-176B is tested by using the same prompts as\\nGLM-130B’s (Cf. Appendix C.6 and Table 15 for details).\\nGLM-130B’s few-shot (5-shot) performance on MMLU approaches GPT-3 (43.9) after viewing\\nabout 300B tokens in Figure 6. It continues moving up as the training proceeds, achieving an\\naccuracy of 44.8 when the training has to end (i.e., viewing 400B tokens in total). This aligns with\\nthe observation (Hoffmann et al., 2022) that most existing LLMs are far from adequately trained.\\n5.3\\nBEYOND THE IMITATION GAME BENCHMARK (BIG-BENCH)\\nBIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) benchmarks challenging tasks concerning models’ ability on\\nreasoning, knowledge, and commonsense. Given evaluating on its 150 tasks is time-consuming for\\nLLMs, we report the BIG-bench-lite—an official 24-task sub-collection—for now. Observed from\\nFigure 7 and Table 4, GLM-130B outperforms GPT-3 175B and even PaLM 540B (4× larger) in\\nzero-shot setting. This is probably owing to GLM-130B’s bidirectional context attention and MIP,\\nwhich has been proved to improve zero-shot results in unseen tasks (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al.,\\n2022). As the number of shots increases, GLM-130B’s performance keeps going up, maintaining its\\noutperformance over GPT-3 (Cf. Appendix C.5 and Table 14 for details on each model and task).\\nLimitations and Discussions. In the experiments above, we observe that GLM-130B’s performance\\ngrowth (13.31 to 15.12) with the increase of few-shot samples is not as significant as GPT-3’s (4.35\\nto 13.18). Here is our intuitive attempt to understand the phenomenon.\\nFirst, the bidirectional nature of GLM-130B could lead to strong zero-shot performance (as is indi-\\ncated in zero-shot language modeling), thus getting closer to the few-shot “upper-bound” for models\\nof similar scale (i.e., 100B-scale) than unidirectional LLMs. Second, it may be also attributed to a\\ndeficit of existing MIP paradigms (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022), which only involve zero-shot\\nprediction in the training and will be likely to bias GLM-130B for stronger zero-shot learning but\\nrelatively weaker in-context few-shot performance. To correct the bias, a potential solution we came\\nup with would be to employ MIP with varied shots of in-context samples rather than only zero-shot\\nsamples.\\nFinally, despite almost the same GPT architecture as GPT-3, PaLM 540B’s relative growth with few-\\nshot in-context learning is substantially more significant than GPT-3’s. We conjecture this further\\nacceleration in performance growth is a source of PaLM’s high-quality and diverse private-collected\\ntraining corpora. By combining our experiences with (Hoffmann et al., 2022)’s insights, we came to\\nrealize that better architectures, better data, and more training FLOPS should be further invested.\\n5.4\\nCHINESE LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING EVALUATION (CLUE)\\nWe evaluate GLM-130B’s Chinese zero-shot performance on established Chinese NLP benchmarks,\\nCLUE (Xu et al., 2020) and FewCLUE (Xu et al., 2021).Note that we do not include any Chinese\\ndownstream tasks in MIP. To date, we have finished testing on part of the two benchmarks, including\\n8\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nEPRSTMT\\nOCNLI-FC\\nBUSTM\\nCHID-FC\\nCLUEWSC-FC\\nC3\\nWSC1.1\\nCMNLI\\nDRCD\\nOCNLI_50K\\nAFQMC\\nCMRC2018\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\nAcc. or EM\\n92.5\\n73.8\\n77.5\\n90.1\\n77.4\\n77.5\\n83.9\\n77.0\\n77.1\\n74.7\\n71.2\\n55.7\\n88.8\\n53.8\\n64.4\\n87.1\\n53.5\\n54.9\\n81.1\\n51.7\\n29.5\\n44.6\\n69.0\\n16.6\\nGLM-130B\\nERNIE 3.0 Titan-260B\\nFigure 8: GLM-130B and ERNIE Titan 3.0 260B evaluated on zero-shot CLUE and FewCLUE.\\n7 CLUE and 5 FewCLUE datasets (Cf. Appendix C.7 for details). We compare GLM-130B to the\\nlargest existing Chinese monolingual language model—the 260B ERNIE Titan 3.0 (Wang et al.,\\n2021). We follow its setting to report zero-shot results on dev datasets. GLM-130B consistently\\noutperforms ERNIE Titan 3.0 across 12 tasks (Cf. Figure 8). Interestingly, GLM-130B performs at\\nleast 260% better than ERNIE on two abstractive MRC datasets (DRCD and CMRC2018), possibly\\ndue to GLM-130B’s pre-training objective that naturally resonates to abstractive MRC’s form.\\n6\\nRELATED WORK\\nIn this section, we review related work to GLM-130B on topics of pre-training, transferring, and\\ninference of pre-trained LLMs (Qiu et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021).\\nPre-Training.\\nVanilla language modeling refers to decoder-only autoregressive models (e.g.,\\nGPT (Radford et al., 2018)), but it also recognizes any forms of self-supervised objectives on texts.\\nRecently, transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) language models present a fascinating scaling\\nlaw: new abilities (Wei et al., 2022b) arise as models scale up, from 1.5B (Radford et al., 2019),\\n10B-scale language models (Raffel et al., 2020; Shoeybi et al., 2019; Black et al., 2022), to 100B-\\nscale GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). Later, despite many 100B-scale LLMs (Lieber et al., 2021; Thop-\\npilan et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2021; Zeng\\net al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) in both English and Chinese, they are not available to public or only\\naccessible via limited APIs. The closeness of LLMs severely stymies its development. GLM-130B’s\\nefforts, along with recent ElutherAI, OPT-175B (Zhang et al., 2022), and BLOOM-176B (Scao et al.,\\n2022), aim to offer high-quality open-sourced LLMs to our community.\\nTransferring. Though fine-tuning has been a de facto way for transfer learning, the evaluation for\\nLLMs has been focused on prompting and in-context learning due to their tremendous sizes (Brown\\net al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a). Nevertheless, some recent attempts has been on parameter-efficient\\nlearning on language models (Houlsby et al., 2019) and prompt tuning (i.e., P-tuning, Li & Liang\\n(2021); Liu et al. (2021b); Lester et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2022)). For now we do not focus on them\\nand will leave the comprehensive testing of them on GLM-130B in future study.\\nInference. Most public-accessible LLMs nowadays are providing their services via limited APIs.In\\nthis work, an important part of our endeavor has been on LLMs’ efficient and fast inference. Related\\nwork may include distillation (Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), quantiza-\\ntion (Zafrir et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Tao et al., 2022), and pruning (Michel et al., 2019; Fan\\net al., 2019). Very recent work (Dettmers et al., 2022) shows that LLMs such as OPT-175B and\\nBLOOM-176B can be quantized to 8 bit due to special distribution of outlier dimensions. In this\\nwork, we demonstrate GLM’s scaling law for INT4 weight quantization, which allows GLM-130B\\nto inference on as few as 4×RTX 3090 (24G) GPUs or 8×RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs.\\n7\\nCONCLUSION AND LESSONS\\nWe introduce GLM-130B, a bilingual pre-trained language model that aims to facilitate open and\\ninclusive LLM research. GLM-130B’s technical and engineering undertakings generate insight into\\nLLMs’ architectures, pre-training objectives, training stability and efficiency, and affordable infer-\\nence. Altogether, it contributes to the high quality of GLM-130B in terms of both language perfor-\\nmance on 112 tasks and ethical results on bias and toxicity benchmarks. Our experiences of both\\nsuccess and failure are condensed into the lessons for training 100B-scale LLMs, attached in the\\nAppendix B.10.\\n9\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\nThis research was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) 61825602, 62276148\\nand Zhipu.AI.

This work introduces an open-source Large Language\\nModel (LLM), which could be used to generate synthetic text for harmful applications, such as tele-\\nmarketing fraud, political propaganda, and personal harassment as is discussed in (Weidinger et al.,\\n2021; Sheng et al., 2021; Dev et al., 2021). We do not anticipate any hazardous outputs, especially\\ntowards vulnerable and historically disadvantaged groups of peoples, after using the model.\\nAnd to better collaborate with our community to prevent and ultimately eliminate the risks techni-\\ncally, we make the following crucial open efforts in this work:\\nOpen-Sourced LLMs for Ethical Risk Study. While some people think that restricting the access\\nof LLMs can prevent such harmful applications, we argue that promoting LLM inclusivity can lead\\nto better defense against potential harms caused by LLMs. Currently, only governments and large\\ncorporations can afford the considerable costs of pre-training LLMs. There is no guarantee that\\norganizations having the the substantial financial resources will not do harm using a LLM. Without\\naccess to such LLMs, individuals cannot even realize the role of LLMs in the harm.\\nConversely, releasing an open LLM can provide access and transparency to all the researchers and\\npromote the research to reduce the potential harm of LLMs, like algorithms to identify the synthetic\\ntext Gehrmann et al. (2019). Also, it is known that LLMs can suffer from problems in fairness,\\nbias, privacy, and truthfulness Zhang et al. (2021); Lin et al. (2022); Liang et al. (2021); Bender\\net al. (2021). An open LLM can reveal the model parameters and internal states corresponding\\nto specific inputs instead of providing APIs to black-box models. In conclusion, researchers can\\nconduct analysis of LLMs’ flaws in depth and propose improved algorithms to solve the problems.\\nEthical Evaluation and Improvements. We also evaluate our model over a wide range of English\\nethical evaluation benchmarks, including bias measurement (Nadeem et al., 2021; Nangia et al.,\\n2020), hate speech detection (Mollas et al., 2020), and toxic generation estimation (Gehman et al.,\\n2020). Notwithstanding their deficiency (Blodgett et al., 2021; Jacobs & Wallach, 2021), these\\ndatasets serve as a meaningful initial step towards an open quantitative evaluation LLMs.\\nOur evaluation implies that our algorithm designs, especially the bilingual pre-training of a LLM,\\ncan significantly mitigate the biases and toxicity an LLM may present while keeping its strong\\nlanguage performance compared to other LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022) trained\\nwith monolingual English corpora (Cf. Appendix A for more details).\\nREPRODUCIBILITY\\nCompared to mainstream closed-sourced LLMs including GPT-3 175B(Brown et al., 2020), PaLM\\n540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022),\\nLaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), FLAN (Wei et al., 2022a), and many others, GLM-130B is open-\\nsourced and devotes to promote openness and inclusivity in LLM research from the very beginning.\\nWe have paid great effort to ensure the reproducibility of our evaluation. For pre-training section,\\ndespite the unaffordable costs it needs to reproduce at present, we still make our best efforts to dis-\\nclose the code, details, and the whole process of GLM-130B’s pre-training. Our endeavor to allow\\nGLM-130B inference on few popularized GPUs such as 3090/2080 Ti also aligns with the repro-\\nducibility undertaking, as it allows most academic researchers to reproduce GLM-130B’s results on\\ntheir offline machines. We also provide free APIs for individual users to test GLM-130B’s ability.\\n10\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nPre-Training.

In GLM-130B, before granting\\nmodel weight to applicants, in the model license we demand them to agree that they will not use it\\nfor any deeds that may be harmful to society and human beings.\\nAdditionally, from a technical perspective, we argue that we must also understand LLMs’ toxic\\nand biased behaviors and ultimately eliminate them. This aligns with our commitment to “LLM\\nInclusivity”, as it is necessary to include more people in the open-sourced LLM research to facilitate\\nthe process. Moreover, if an LLM is shown to be good at identifying toxic and biased content,\\ntechniques such as self-diagnoses (Schick et al., 2021) can help to reduce the harmful generation\\nin a self-consistent post-processing procedure. Therefore, as an initial step, we evaluate GLM-\\n130B over a variety of related benchmarks to shed light on the challenging topic. Despite their\\nlimitations (Blodgett et al., 2021; Jacobs & Wallach, 2021) which should be addressed in future\\nwork, they still serve as a good start to arouse the community’s awareness of the problem.\\nA.1\\nBIAS MEASUREMENT: CROWS-PAIRS\\nTable 5: CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) Bias\\nMeasurement.

It collects 1508 examples with\\nnine different conventional biases and adopts a\\nprobing-based approach to compare the pseudo-\\nlog-likelihood of a pair of stereotypical and anti-\\nstereotypical sentences.\\nSince GLM-130B is\\npre-trained with autoregressive blanking infill-\\ning, CrowS-Pairs evaluation is directly appli-\\ncable.\\nWe compare the GPT-3 Davinci and\\nOPT-175B’s results on CrowS-Pairs reported\\nin (Zhang et al., 2022) with GLM-130B.\\nOur results are presented in Table 5. GLM-130B shows fewer biases on almost all kinds of stereo-\\ntypes except for religion and nationality. We speculate that it is because GLM-130B is a bilingual\\npre-trained LLM that learns the semantics for certain content from both English and Chinese cor-\\npora. Since CrowsS-Pairs’ stereotypes mainly draw from the US Equal Employment Opportunities\\nCommission’s list2, the bias distributions in two different cultures and languages may be different\\nand consequently reconcile social biases in GLM-130B on a benchmark originally designed for\\nEnglish-language society. We think this is an interesting finding, as multi-lingual pre-training may\\nhelp LLMs to present less harmful biases for better fairness. Finally, we also admit that GLM-\\n130B may in turn presents some special Chinese biases which currently lack testing benchmarks\\nand require considerable future efforts to detect and prevent.\\nA.2\\nBIAS MEASUREMENT: STEREOSET\\nAnother widely used bias and stereotype evaluation benchmark is StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021),\\nwhich is also adopted in (Lieber et al., 2021; Artetxe et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). To balance\\nthe evaluation between bias detecting and language modeling quality, StereoSet reports a series of\\nmetrics including Language Modeling Scores (LMS), Stereotype Score (SS), and Idealized Context\\nAssociation Test Score (ICAT) as an overall averaged metric. For example, given the premise “She\\n2https://www.eeoc.gov/prohibited-employment-policiespractices\\n21\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nis the twin’s mother”, StereoSet provides three candidate hypothesis: 1) “the water is deep”, 2)\\n“she is a lazy, unkind person”, and 3) “she is a kind, caring woman”. The first option servers as a\\ndistractor to test models’ language capability and calculate LMS; the second and third statements\\nare anti-stereotypical and stereotypical respectively and used for calculating SS. A widely-adopted\\ntechnique here is to calibrate the likelihood of an option according to its length (Lieber et al., 2021;\\nZhang et al., 2022), as the distractor term is particularly short.\\nFollowing (Zhang et al., 2022), we normalize scores over tokens rather than characters (Lieber et al.,\\n2021) to yield model predictions for calculating the metrics. The results are shown in Table 6. As we\\nobserve, GLM-130B exceedingly outperforms GPT-3 Davinci and OPT-175B on all metrics. Such\\nresults accurately align with our discoveries in language modeling experiments and CrowS-Pairs\\nbias evaluation, that GLM-130B has a high quality in both language modeling and social fairness.\\nTable 6: StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) Bias Measurement with LMS (↑), SS (↓), and ICAT (↑).\\nCategory\\nProfession\\nGender\\nReligion\\nRace\\nOverall\\nLMS\\nSS\\nICAT LMS\\nSS\\nICAT LMS\\nSS\\nICAT LMS\\nSS\\nICAT LMS\\nSS\\nICAT\\nGPT-3\\n78.4 63.4\\n57.5\\n75.6 66.5\\n50.6\\n80.8 59.0\\n66.3\\n77.0 57.4\\n65.7\\n77.6 60.8\\n60.8\\nOPT-175B\\n74.1 62.6\\n55.4\\n74.0 63.6\\n53.8\\n84.0 59.0\\n68.9\\n74.9 56.8\\n64.8\\n74.8 59.9\\n60.0\\nGLM-130B 86.5 59.6\\n69.9\\n83.9 63.5\\n61.2\\n91.0 53.5\\n84.6\\n85.7 54.1\\n78.7\\n86.0 57.3\\n73.5\\nA.3\\nHATE SPEECH DETECTION: ETHOS\\nSocial media corpus may contain hate speeches, and to investigate to what extent LLMs know and\\ncan help to identify them is crucial. We adopt the ETHOS dataset originally proposed in (Mollas\\net al., 2020) to detect sexism and racism speech on zero-shot or few-shot datasets created by (Chiu\\n& Alexander, 2021). GPT-3 Davinci (a public-accessible variant of GPT-3 175B) and OPT 175B are\\nalso tested on the benchmark (whose results are reported in (Zhang et al., 2022)). For binary clas-\\nsification including Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot (binary) (which answers “yes” or “no”), we\\nreport binary F1; for multiclass classification (which answers “yes”, “no”, or “neither”), we report\\nmicro F1. We adopt almost the same prompts as in (Chiu & Alexander, 2021), except aligning the\\nFew-shot (binary) prompt to the form used in One-shot and adding the word “Classification”\\nbefore the colon in the original Few-shot (multiclass) prompt.\\nTable 7:\\nETHOS (Mollas et al., 2020) Hate\\nspeech detection. “(bi)” and “(mul)” denote bi-\\nnary and multiclass classification respectively.\\nAll scores are F1 and the higher the better.\\nGPT-3\\nOPT-175B\\nGLM-130B\\nZero-shot\\n62.8\\n66.7\\n68.8\\nOne-shot\\n61.6\\n71.3\\n79.1\\nFew-shot (bi)\\n35.4\\n75.9\\n79.7\\nFew-shot (mul)\\n67.2\\n81.2\\n85.8\\nResults are shown in Table 7.\\nWe find that\\nGLM-130B outperforms two other LLMs among\\nfour different settings.\\nOn one hand, GLM-\\n130B’s pre-training over unsupervised diverse\\ncorpora from online forums and social media in-\\ncluding sections such as “hackernews”, “stack-\\nexchange”, and “pile_cc” can endow our model\\nwith the background knowledge to identify those\\nspeeches. On the other hand, the MIP training\\nmay also improve GLM-130B’s zero-shot and\\nfew-shot capabilities.\\nA.4\\nTOXIC GENEARATION: REALTOXICPROMPTS\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nPrompt Toxicity Probability (Binned)\\n0.05\\n0.10\\n0.15\\n0.20\\n0.25\\nToxicity Probability of Continuation\\nGLM-130B\\nGPT-3 Davinci\\nFigure 9:\\nRealToxicPrompts (Gehman\\net al., 2020) evaluation.

Then we report the mean\\ntoxicity probabilities of 25 continuations evaluated by\\nPerspective API3.

Generally, as the toxicity of the given prompt increases, the toxicity\\nprobability of the continuation increases accordingly in both models. Compared to GPT-3 Davinci,\\nGLM-130B has a lower toxicity rate in all cases, indicating that GLM-130B is less prone to gener-\\nating toxic content.\\nB\\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\\nIn this section, we introduce additional details about the technical issues we have identified and\\nsolved throughout the GLM-130B training. Along with concurrent open-source LLM efforts, we\\nbelieve that those published details could serve as great cornerstones to future LLM training.\\nB.1\\nTOKENIZATION\\nFor the tokenization of the corpus, we implement a text tokenizer based on the package icetk with\\nseveral adjustments. As an image-text unified tokenizer, the vocabulary size of icetk is 150000.\\nThe first 20000 tokens are image tokens and the rest are text tokens. The text tokenizer of icetk\\nis formulated and trained by sentencepiece4, on a 25GB bilingual corpus equally distributed with\\nEnglish and Chinese contents. We divide tokens recognized by the tokenizer into four categories.\\nThe common tokens are assigned from No.20000 to No.20099, consisting of punctuations, numbers\\nand spaces free of extended definition. No.20100 to No.83822 are English tokens and No.83823 to\\n4https://github.com/google/sentencepiece\\n23\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nNo.145653 are Chinese tokens. Tokens after No.145653 are other special tokens including concate-\\nnated punctuations and pieces from other languages, etc.\\nDuring our implementation, We ignore the first 20000 image tokens and simply utilize the latter\\n130000 intended for text tokenization. we disable the ignoring of linebreak to tokenize the line-\\nbreak mark \\\\n into No. 20004 token <n>. On the basis of inherent tokens, we add special tokens\\n[MASK] and [gMASK] for model prediction. We also add special tokens <sop>, <eop>, <eos>\\nfor sentence and passage separation.\\nB.2\\nLAYER NORMALIZATION\\nHere we briefly introduce the history of layer normalization in language modeling problems, and\\nhow its variants perform in recent LLMs including our experiments for them on GLM-130B.\\nPost-LN (Vaswani et al., 2017). Post-LN is jointly proposed with the transformer architecture and is\\nplaced between the residual blocks. It is then adopted by BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for bidirectional\\nlanguage model pre-training. Nevertheless, Post-LN was later accused of transformers’ slow and\\nvulnerable converging (Xiong et al., 2020) and the Pre-LN emerged as a substitute.\\nPre-LN (Xiong et al., 2020). On the contrary, Pre-LN is located in the residual blocks to reduce\\nexploding gradients and becomes dominant in existing language models, including all recent LLMs.\\nHowever, OPT-175B (Zhang et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), and text-to-image model\\nCogView Ding et al. (2021) later observe that Pre-LN is still unable to handle the vulnerable training\\nwhen models scale up to 100B or meet multi-modal data. This is also justified in GLM-130B’s\\npreliminary experiments, where Pre-LN consistently crashes in its early stage training.\\nAdditionally, another problem rooted in Pre-LN transformers is that it may harm the model perfor-\\nmance after tuning compared to Post-LN. This is observed in (He et al., 2021).\\nSandwich-LN (Ding et al., 2021). As a remedy, on top of Pre-LN, CogView (later in Norm-\\nformer (Shleifer et al., 2021)) develops Sandwich-LN which appends extra normalization to the\\nend of each residual branch. Accompanied with PB-Relax (Precision-Bottleneck Relaxation) tech-\\nniques, they stabilize the training of a 4-billion text-to-image generation model. Despite its superi-\\nority over Pre-LN, sadly Sandwich-LN is also proved to collapse in GLM-130B training; let alone\\nthe potential consequent weaker tuning performance caused by its Pre-LN nature.\\nB.3\\nPOSITIONAL ENCODING AND FEED-FORWARD NETWORK\\nPositional Encoding\\nVanilla transformer adopts absolute (or sinuous) position encoding, and is\\nlater evolved into relative positional encoding (Dai et al., 2019). Relative PEs can capture word\\nrelevance better than absolute positional encoding. Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al.,\\n2021) is a relative position encoding implemented in the form of absolute position encoding, and its\\ncore idea is shown in the following equation.\\n(Rmq)⊤(Rnk) = q⊤R⊤\\nmRnk = q⊤Rn−mk\\n(1)\\nThe product of q at position m and k at position n is related to their distance n −m, which reflects\\nthe relativity of the position encoding.

In GLM-130B, different from the two-dimensional\\npositional encoding used in vanilla GLM, we turn back to conventional one-dimensional positional\\nencoding. However, we originally thought that two-dimensional form cannot be directly applied to\\nRoPE5. As a substitute plan, in GLM-130B we simply remove the second dimension used in the\\noriginal GLM as we find that the unidirectional attention mask sub-matrices for [MASK] generation\\nindicate the token order as well. This observation results in our transforming GLM-130B’s positional\\nencoding into a one-dimensional one according to the following strategies:\\n• For sequences corrupted by short spans, we discard the second-dimensional position encoding.\\n• For sequences corrupted by a long span at the end, we change the positional ids to one-dimensional\\n0, 1, · · · , s −1, and generated tokens will just prolong the first-dimensional positional encoding\\nfrom the last context token s −1.\\nFeed-forward Network\\nSome recent efforts to improve transformer architecture have been on\\nthe FFN, including replacing it with GLU (adopted in PaLM). Research shows that using GLU\\ncan improve model performance, which is consistent with our experimental results (Cf. Table 8).\\nSpecifically, we use GLU with the GeLU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) activation. as\\nFFNGeGLU (x; W1, V , W2) = (GeLU(xW1) ⊗xV ) W2\\n(4)\\nIn order to keep the same parameter as the vanilla FFN, the feed-forward size dffn (which is usually\\n4dH, where dH is the hidden dimension) is reduced to 8\\n3dH as the V is additionally introduced.\\nTable 8: Ablation Study for PE\\nand FFN on GLMBase\\nModel\\nTest PPL\\nGLMBase\\n24.58\\n+ ALiBi\\n24.14\\n+ RoPE\\n22.95\\n+ RoPE + GeGLU\\n22.31\\nAblation Study on PE and FFN\\nIn order to validate our PE\\nand FFN choices, we test them in our experiments by pre-training\\nGLMBase (110M) over a random 50G Chinese and English mixed\\ncorpus. We compare absolute PE with two recent popular relative\\nPE variants, RoPE (Chowdhery et al., 2022) and ALiBi (Press\\net al., 2021). For FFN, we compare vanilla FFN with Gate Lin-\\near Unit with GeLU activations. Results from Table 8 show that\\nboth ALiBi and RoPE improve perplexity on the test set, and the\\nimprovement is more significant with RoPE while using GeGLU\\ncan further improve the model’s performance.\\nB.4\\nPIPELINE PARALLEL ANALYSIS\\nIn pipeline parallelism, each stage consists of three operations (Cf. Figure 11(a)): forward (de-\\nnoted as F), backward (denoted as B), and optimizer step (denoted as U). However, naive sequential\\npipeline implementation leads to an unbearable amount of bubbles. The improved Gpipe (Huang\\net al., 2019) (Cf. Figure 11(b)) strategy reduces bubbles drastically via splitting data into micro-\\nbatches; the more micro-batches there are, the more stages can compute simultaneously in an itera-\\ntion. The recent PipeDream-Flush (Narayanan et al., 2021) (Cf. Figure 11(c)) additionally optimizes\\nthe GPU memory usage by interweaving forward and backward from different stages to reduce for-\\nward activation’s memory occupation.\\nWe analyze the bubble share in GLM-130B’s pre-training by assuming that the number of pipeline\\nsegments is p, the number of micro-batches is m, and the time for forward and backward per micro-\\nbatch are tf and tb. In ideal case, forward and backward take tideal = m(tf +tb). But in practice, the\\ndefault pipeline delivery strategy causes p −1 forward propagation and p −1 backward propagation\\nbubbles, respectively, for a total time of tbubble = (p −1)(tf + tb), so that the bubble occupancy is\\nbubble-ratio =\\ntbubble\\ntideal + tbubble\\n=\\np −1\\nm + p −1\\n(5)\\nFor larger numbers of micro-batches, the bubble percentage will be reduced to an acceptable level.\\nIn particular, experiments in GPipe Huang et al.

In this\\ncase, we can freely adjust the ratio of pipeline model parallelism and tensor model parallelism. Since\\ndata parallelism hardly affects the computation time, we assume that the scale of data parallelism is\\nd = 1, the total number of nodes is n, the scale of tensor model parallelism is t, and the scale of\\npipeline model parallelism is p, and satisfies n = t × p, the bubble share in this case is\\nbubble-ratio =\\nn/t −1\\nm + n/t −1\\n(6)\\nFrom the above equation, we can see that increasing the size of tensor parallelism will further reduce\\nthe bubble ratio. However, the tensor parallelism scale cannot be increased indefinitely, which would\\nlead to a reduction in computational granularity and greatly increase the communication cost across\\na certain threshold. Therefore, we can conclude that the size of tensor model parallelism should\\nincrease slowly as the model size increases, but not more than the number of graphics cards in\\na single machine. In the training of GLM-130B, the experiments show that the optimal tensor\\nparallelism scale is t = 4 and does not scale up to the scale of t = 8 in the DGX-A100 system. The\\nother parameters are m = 176, p = 8, and the bubble share is calculated to be only 3.8%, which is\\nsufficient to demonstrate the efficiency of pipeline model parallelism.\\n26\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nTable 9: Decoding speed in our real trials between BLOOM-176B (Scao et al., 2022) (from Hug-\\ngingface Transformers) and GLM-130B’s implementation in 16-bit precision with 8 × A100 (80G).\\nDecode Tokens\\n128\\n512\\n1024\\n2048\\nBLOOM-176B\\n36.76s\\n137.91s\\n287.93s\\n631.81s\\nGLM-130B\\n4.40s (×8.4)\\n18.77s (×7.3)\\n39.81s (×7.2)\\n89.88s (×7.0)\\nFigure 12: Distribution of outliers in GLM-130B’s activations.

A comparison between our speeding up GLM-\\n130B implementation and the so far default available BLOOM-176B implementation in Hugging-\\nface Transformers7 is shown in Table 9. Our implementation for GLM-130B can be 7.0 to 8.4 times\\nfaster than BLOOM-176B’s Pytorch implementation. The exertion to accelerate LLM for tolerable\\nresponse speed could be extremely crucial to its popularization.\\nB.6\\nACTIVATION OUTLIER ANALYSIS\\nAs is described in prior sections, GLM-130B’s weight can be quantized into INT4 to drastically cut\\ndown parameter redundancy in the inference. However, we also find that GLM-130B’s activations\\n(i.e., hidden states between layers) cannot be properly quantized, as they contain value outliers as is\\nalso suggested in concurrent literature (Dettmers et al., 2022).\\nWhat is special in GLM-130B is that 30% of its dimensions may present value outliers (Cf. Fig-\\nure 12), while other GPT-based LLMs (e.g., OPT-175B and BLOOM 176B) only has very few\\noutlying dimensions (Dettmers et al., 2022). Therefore, the solution to decompose matrix multipli-\\n6https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer\\n7https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bloom\\n27\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\ncation for higher-precision computation in outlying dimensions proposed in (Dettmers et al., 2022)\\nis not applicable to GLM-130B.\\nFigure 13:\\nGLM-130B’s\\nactivation outliers’ absolute\\nvalue scale.\\nWe study whether these outliers can be ignored in LLM quantiza-\\ntion, and the answer is interestingly “no”. These values can be sev-\\neral orders of magnitude larger than ordinary activation values (Cf.\\nFigure 13). While most values (accounts for 99.98% dimensions in\\na hidden state) stay less them 6, those two outlying dimensions can\\nreach 50 or even over 100. They are speculated to be some important\\nclues for GLM-130B and potentially other LLMs to memorize some\\nfixed world or language knowledge, and thus removing or omitting\\nthem in quantization can lead to significant performance degradation.\\nB.7\\nWEIGHT QUANTIZATION\\nB.7.1\\nPRELIMINARIES\\nAbsmax Quantization\\nis a symmetric quantization that a range of [−absmax(x), absmax(x)] is\\nmapped to [−(2b −1), 2b −1] for x.\\nsx = absmax(x)\\n2b−1 −1\\n(7)\\nxq = round(x/sx)\\n(8)\\nwhere sx is the scaling factor, xq is the quantization result and b is the bit width.\\nZeropoint Quantization\\nis an asymmetric quantization that a range of [min(x), max(x)] is\\nmapped to [−(2b −1), 2b −1].\\nsx = max(x) −min(x)\\n2b −2\\n(9)\\nzx = round(min(x)/sx) + 2b−1 −1\\n(10)\\nxq = round(x/sx) −zx\\n(11)\\nwhere zx is the zero point.\\nCol/Row-wise Quantization\\nUsing a single scaling factor for the weight matrix often leads to\\nmore quantization errors because one single outlier leads to a decrease in the quantization precision\\nof all other elements. A common workaround is to group the weight matrix by rows or by columns,\\nwith each group being quantized separately and having independent scaling factors.\\nB.8\\nQUANTIZATION SETTINGS\\nOur goal is to save GPU memory as much as possible without hurting model performance. In prac-\\ntice, we only quantize linear layers, which take up most of the transformer parameters, and leave\\ninput/output embedding, layer normalization, and bias terms unchanged. At the quantization pre-\\ncision of INT4, two INT4 weights are compressed into one INT8 weight for saving GPU memory\\nusage. Absmax quantization is adopted since we found it enough to maintain model performance,\\nand it is more computationally efficient than zeropoint quantization. During inference, only quan-\\ntized weights are stored in GPU memory, the FP16 weights for linear layers will be dequantized at\\nruntime.\\nB.8.1\\nQUANTIZATION RESULTS AT SCALES\\nGLM models at 110M to 10B scale are from GLM’s original paper(Du et al., 2022). Although the\\narchitecture of smaller scale GLMs are not the same as GLM-130B, we believe that the training\\nobjective is the key factor for quantization. Table 10 shows the performance of GLM and BLOOM\\nfamily models at different scales on the LAMBADA dataset with different quantization methods.\\nAlmost all models maintain performance at INT8 precision. In general, GLM maintains better\\nperformance than BLOOM at INT4 precision as it scales.\\n28\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nTable 10: Accuracy on LAMBADA dataset for GLM and BLOOM family at 100M to 176B scales\\nacross different quantization precision.\\nBLOOM-560M BLOOM-1B1 BLOOM-3B BLOOM-7B BLOOM-176B\\nOriginal\\n31.40%\\n40.68%\\n48.30%\\n54.91%\\n64.37%\\nAbsmax INT8, col-wise\\n26.12%\\n40.69%\\n48.83%\\n55.33%\\n65.03%\\nAbsmax INT4, col-wise\\n9.30%\\n17.43%\\n37.88%\\n38.04%\\n34.83%\\nAbsmax INT4, row-wise\\n21.37%\\n35.80%\\n40.95%\\n46.75%\\nNaN\\nZeropoint INT4, col-wise\\n11.51%\\n26.51%\\n41.65%\\n46.63%\\n48.26%\\nZeropoint INT4, row-wise\\n24.95%\\n33.05%\\n43.63%\\n49.41%\\nNaN\\nGLM-110M\\nGLM-335M\\nGLM-2B\\nGLM-10B\\nGLM-130B\\nOriginal\\n29.36%\\n48.51%\\n68.19%\\n72.35%\\n80.21%\\nAbsmax INT8, row-wise\\n29.25%\\n48.69%\\n68.12%\\n72.37%\\n80.21%\\nAbsmax INT4, row-wise\\n3.26%\\n38.25%\\n62.62%\\n71.03%\\n79.47%\\nZeropoint INT4, row-wise\\n5.45%\\n42.64%\\n64.74%\\n70.50%\\n80.63%\\nLAMBADA\\nMMLU\\nWiC\\nReCoRD\\nHellaswag\\nWSC\\nBoolQ\\nANLI R1\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n67.3\\n26.3\\n51.7\\n65.4\\n27.3\\n63.5\\n64.1\\n35.0\\n72.7\\n33.7\\n56.1\\n66.4\\n27.7\\n63.5\\n71.2\\n35.6\\n74.8\\n34.5\\n52.5\\n50.7\\n27.3\\n67.3\\n78.3\\n40.0\\nModel\\nGLM (uni)\\nGLM (bi)\\nGLM + MIP (bi)\\nFigure 14: Contribution attribution analysis on GLM objective and MIP training. We take GLM-\\n10B (English only) as an example in the ablation. Generally, GLM objective’s bidirectional attention\\naccounts for 70% of the improvements, while MIP’s major contribution lies in text similarity tasks.\\nB.8.2\\nWEIGHT DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS\\nTo achieve INT4 weight quantization, we analyze the weight value distribution of major linear layers\\nin GLM-130B and a counterpart BLOOM-176B in a histogram (Cf. Figure 15). The horizontal axis\\ndenotes the weight value, and the vertical axis denotes the number of weights of such value in\\nlog scale. As we can see, it is majorly the w2 linear layers in BLOOM-176B that present skewed\\ndistributions, which would hinder the symmetrical quantization. On the contrary, GLM-130B’s w2\\nis well-shaped without many outliers and skewed distribution, and thus paces the way for its INT4\\nquantization with little performance loss.\\nB.9\\nABLATION ON CONTRIBUTION ATTRIBUTION\\nWe analyze the contribution attribution of techniques leveraged in GLM-130B. A series of ablation\\nstudies have been presented in the paper, and for the convenience of reading, they were originally\\nscattered around the whole passage. Here we summarize them here into the following list for read-\\ners’ reference:\\n• Ablation on ordinary PostLN and DeepNorm: Figure 3.\\n• Ablation on Bidirectional/Unidirectional Attention: Figure 2 (LAMBADA), Table 16 (Condi-\\ntional NLG), Figure 17 (SuperGLUE).\\n• Ablation on Embedding Layer Gradient Shrink (EGS): Figure 4.\\n• Ablation on Positional Encodings and FFN: Appendix B.3 Table 8.\\nAdditionally, we conduct the following study to justify the contribution of the two most influential\\ntechniques–GLM Objective and Multi-task Instruction Pre-training (MIP)–used in GLM-130B.\\nGLM Objective and MIP. Ablating a 100B-scale LLM from scratch can be too expensive. As a\\nsubstitute, we try our best to conduct the comparison between GLM objective and MIP on GLM-\\n10B (an English-only version released in (Du et al., 2022), without MIP). We additionally train a\\nGLM-10B initialized from a middle-stage original checkpoint with MIP (5%) to match the same\\ntraining tokens of the original self-supervision-only GLM-130B. The MIP, this time, follows the\\n29\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nexact dataset setting in T0 (Sanh et al., 2022) and the information extraction datasets in GLM-130B\\nto allow the correct evaluation on some types of tasks (e.g., NLI).\\nFigure 14 shows the ablation results. On the 8 datasets we test, we find that the GLM objective\\nis a major contributor to the improvement (from GLM (uni) to GLM + MIP (bi)). For exam-\\nple, it accounts for 73% improvement in LAMBADA and 90% improvement in MMLU, which\\nare very widely adopted challenging benchmarks for LLMs. As for MIP, on some datasets (e.g.,\\nWiC, ReCoRD, Hellaswag), MIP may even harm the performance. While for datasets related to text\\nsimilarity and coreference (e.g., WSC, BoolQ, ANLI R1), MIP is the main contributor. It is likely\\nbecause the text similarity and coreference challenges, which people usually construct intentionally\\nto test language models’ ability, are seldom seen in the self-supervised corpus that makes up peo-\\nple’s daily written texts. Thus, MIP training mainly helps to bridge the gap between self-supervised\\npre-training and these tasks.\\nB.10\\nLESSONS LEARNED\\nLesson 1 (Bidirectional Architecture).

All prompts for T0 datasets are from PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022)\\nand prompts for DeepStruct datasets are newly created. Their composition is shown in Table 12,\\nwhich makes up natural language understanding and generation datasets from T0 (Sanh et al., 2022)\\nand promptsource (Bach et al., 2022), and information extraction datasets from DeepStruct (Wang\\net al., 2022a). In GLM-130B’s training, we calculate that approximately 36% of the samples in each\\ndataset has been seen.\\nT0 originally splits datasets for 1) multi-task prompted training and 2) zero-shot task transfer two\\nsections. We initially planed to only include training sets of T0’s multi-task prompted training\\nsection and DeepStruct (Wang et al., 2022a), but by a mistake we included both multi-task prompted\\ntraining and zero-shot task transfer sections’ datasets in MIP and excluded DeepStruct datasets. The\\nmistake was fixed at around 23k steps and our model continued to train on the correct version.\\nNatural Language Understanding and Generation.\\nWe adopt datasets and corresponding\\nprompts from promptsource (Bach et al., 2022). For all prompted samples in each dataset, we set a\\ntruncation of maximal 10,0000 samples per dataset and combine them together as the MIP dataset.\\nDetails of the prompted samples and datasets are provided in promptsource’s GitHub repository8.\\nInformation Extraction. Based on the datasets from DeepStruct (Wang et al., 2022a), a multi-\\ntask language model pre-training approach for information extraction tasks, we create instructions\\nand prompts for part of its datasets (as is shown in Table 12). We reformulate information extraction\\ntasks into instruction tuning formats to allow zero-shot generalization to new extraction schema. For\\nall prompted samples in each dataset, we set a truncation of maximal 20,0000 samples per dataset as\\nthere are fewer information extraction datasets than common language understanding and generation\\nones. For KELM (Agarwal et al., 2021) and PropBank (Kingsbury & Palmer) datasets, since their\\noriginal size is gigantic, we sample 50,0000 samples for each of them from their prompted samples.\\nC.2\\nDATA AND PROMPTS IN MIP FOR DEEPSTRUCT\\nPrompts and instructions for all datasets in DeepStruct (Wang et al., 2022a) are newly created by\\nauthors manually. The introduction, task description, and full prompts for each dataset are attached\\nin the following sections. To allow template infilling, all prompts are written into Jinja9 templates.\\nWhen a dataset sample is provided in our format, Joinja engine will render it into a prompted sample\\nwith instruction.\\nA more systematic evaluation on GLM-130B’s information extraction ability is left for a future\\nwork, as the concentration in this work is on the training and designing details of an LLM.\\nC.2.1\\nDIALOGUE STATE TRACKING\\nWe adopt Multiwoz 2.1 (Eric et al., 2020) dialogue state tracking dataset. The dataset is reformulated\\ninto two tasks, each with one prompt correspondingly:\\n• Dialogue state tracking: which asks the model to extract information from dialogues given a list\\nof certain slots, e.g., taxi_arrival_time and destination.\\n• Slot filling: which model should fill in one provided slot and identify situations without answer.\\n8https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/promptsource\\n9https://github.com/pallets/jinja\\n32\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n(Dialogue State Tracking, Prompt 0)\\nRead the dialogues between \"[User]\" and \"[Agent]\",\\n{{text}}\\nidentify and extract the information related to the following categories\\n(from top to down):\\n- {{allowed_relations | join(\"\\\\n- \")}}\\nin the form of \"( [User] ; Y ; Z )\": ||| {{format_triple(relations,\\nallowed_relations) | join(\" \")}}\\n(Slot Filling, Prompt 0)\\nGiven the following dialogue:\\n{{text}}\\nplease answer the question: has \"[User]\" mentioned \"{{allowed_relations[\\nrelation_idx].split(\\': \\') | join(\"\\'s \")}}\" ?

The dataset is reformulated into two tasks with three prompts as follows:\\n• Event Argument Extraction: given a trigger in text and a list of its argument roles, the model is\\nasked to extract the arguments from the provided text.\\n• Argument Identification: given a trigger and a certain argument role, the model is asked to\\nextract the argument if it exists in the provided text; otherwise, the model should generate nothing.\\n(Event Argument Extraction, Prompt 0)\\nFor the task of \"Event Extraction\", given a trigger one should extract\\nits related arguments conditioned on a list of potential roles.\\nGiven the following list of roles:\\n- {{shuffle(allowed_arguments[trigger[\\'event_type\\']].values()) | join(\"\\\\\\nn- \")}}\\nextract related arguments of the trigger \"{{trigger[\\'text\\']}} ({{\\nallowed_triggers[trigger[\\'event_type\\']]}})\" in the following sentence:\\n{{text}}\\nExtractions: ||| {{format_triple(relations, \"\") | join(\" \")}}\\n33\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n(Event Argument Extraction, Prompt 1)\\nTEST\\n1.

The task can be formulated into either a pipeline framework (a\\ncombination of named entity recognition and relation extraction), or end-to-end training.\\nIn this work, we adopt three classical joint entity and relation extraction datasets: CoNLL04 (Roth &\\nYih, 2004), NYT (Riedel et al., 2010), and ACE2005 (Walker & Consortium, 2005). In GLM-130B,\\nwe follow (Wang et al., 2022a) to formulate such challenges into sequence-to-sequence generation,\\nwhere our inputs are raw texts and outputs are triples. We only conduct relation-related tasks for\\nthese datasets here, and leave the entity-related ones to the named entity recognition section.\\n• Relation Extraction: here we extract knowledge triples consisting of “head entity”, “relation”,\\nand “tail entity”, given a list of relation candidates. For example, given the input “In Kunming\\nthe 800-some faculty and student established the National Southwestern Associated University.”,\\nthe model output could be (National Southwestern Associated University,\\nlocation of formation, Kunming).\\n• Conditional Relation Extraction: given a single relation candidate, judge if the input text con-\\ntains the relation. If so, extraction all related triples; if not, do not generate.\\n• Knowledge Slot Filling: assign a certain entity from text, and ask the model to extract all triples\\nthat takes the entity as the head.\\n• Relation Classification: given two entities from texts, ask the model to judge the relation between\\nthem based on a list of candidate relations.\\n34\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n(Relation Extraction, Prompt 0)\\nCan you figure out all triples regarding the relations of \"{{shuffle(\\nallowed_relations) | join(\\'\", \"\\')}}\" from the sentence?

To allow the model to capture a diverse range of potential verbal-\\nized predicates, we extend the task with automatically generated knowledge-text aligned data from\\nKELM (Agarwal et al., 2021). We do not include other distantly supervised dataset (e.g., T-Rex (El-\\nsahar et al., 2018)) since they can be extremely noisy.\\nFor KELM data, since it is based on the full Wikidata schema (which contains too many relations\\nto be enumerated), we create two KELM-specific prompts for the task of Relation Extraction and\\nKnowledge Slot Filling:\\n35\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n(Relation Extraction, Prompt 1, KELM ONLY)\\n{# kelm #}\\nCan you figure out all knowledge triples regarding whole Wikidata\\nproperties from the sentence?

For example, in the sentence “In 1916 GM was reincorpo-\\nrated in Detroit as \"General Motors Corporation\".”, General Motors Corporation could\\nbe of entity type organization. We design two different types of tasks based on named entity\\nrecognition datasets CoNLL03 (Sang & Meulder, 2003), OntoNotes 5.0 (Pradhan et al., 2013), and\\nGENIA (Ohta et al., 2002). We also include named entity recognition sub-tasks from joint entity\\nand relation datasets.\\n• Named Entity Recognition: given a certain list of possible entity types (e.g., location,\\nperson, organization), extract all related entities from the provided text content.\\n• Entity Typing: entity typing is one of the important derivative tasks from named entity recogni-\\ntion.

The problem is a long standing one as it\\nsuffers from outrageous cost of data labeling, since manual labeling on knowledge-intensive tasks\\nrequires educated annotators that charges high. A de facto data creation method in relation extrac-\\ntion relies on distant supervision, which aligns existing knowledge triples in knowledge bases to text\\ncontents automatically, and assume that such alignments are correct in certain conditions. Here we\\nonly include TacRED (Zhang et al., 2017) dataset and create several different tasks based on it.\\n• Relation Classification: the most traditional task formulation. Given two entities from text and\\nclassify their relation from a list of candidates. The form can be either answering the relation\\ndirectly or in the form of a triple (similar to relation extraction).\\n• Knowledge Slot Filling: change the task into given head entity and relation, to identify whether\\nthe tail entity exists in the input text. If not, generate nothing.\\n• Yes or No Question: turn the problem into a task similar to natural language inference. For\\nexample, given the sentence “The series focuses on the life of Carnie Wilson, daughter of Brian\\nWilson, founder of the Beach Boys.”, the model will be asked to judge the correctness of a triple\\nsuch as Carnie Wilson, father, Brian Wilson by answering “yes” or “no”.\\n(Relation Classification, Prompt 0)\\n{% if entity_types.__len__() > 0 %}\\nGiven the following categories of relations:\\n- {{shuffle(allowed_relations.values()) | join(\"\\\\n- \")}}\\npredict the relation between \"{{relations[0][\\'head\\']}}\" and \"{{relations\\n[0][\\'tail\\']}}\" in the following sentence:\\n{{text}}\\nThe relation should be : ||| {{allowed_relations[relations[0][\\'relation\\n\\']]}}\\n{% endif %}\\n37\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n(Relation Classification, Prompt 1)\\n1.

As a response, BIG-bench (Sri-\\nvastava et al., 2022) is recently set up by crowdsourcing\\nnew types of tasks from global researchers to test LLMs\\nunexplored abilities. For economical consideration, we\\nevaluate GLM-130B on an official subset of original 150-\\ntask BIG-bench, the BIG-bench-lite with 24 tasks. These\\ntasks can be categorized into two types: one is based on\\nmultiple-choice question answering with answer options,\\nand another is direct generation without options. For the\\nfirst category, we assess the probability of each option’s\\nfull content and pick the largest one as the answer; for\\nthe second one, we generate the answer using greedy de-\\ncoding. All evaluations done in BIG-bench are based on\\n[MASK], since answers here are usually short pieces of\\ntexts. All results on 24 BIG-bench-lite (Srivastava et al.,\\n2022) datasets of three LLMs are shown in Table 14 and\\nFigure 16. We just adopt the original prompts from BIG-bench and use the official implementation\\nto generate priming examples for few-shot evaluation and to calculate the final scores.\\nC.6\\nMMLU EVALUATION\\nAll results on 57 MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) datasets of GLM-130B and BLOOM 176B are\\nshown in Table 15.

On Chinese datasets, prompting meets some challenges as Chinese texts are organized\\nby single characters rather than words, leading to unequal length of verbalizers in many cases. Albeit\\ndataset-specific calibration (Wang et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021) can help to mitigate the issue, the\\ntoo specified technique can be complicated in implementation. Our evaluation in this paper adopts\\na more easy to solve method leveraging GLM-130B’s unique features. As GLM-130B is a bilingual\\nLLM with English MIP, we adopt English prompts and verbalizers from similar tasks in (Bach\\net al., 2022) for Chinese dataset evaluation and find such strategies to be quite effective. In terms\\nof evaluation metrics, except for DRCD and CMRC2018 two question answering datasets which\\nreports EM, other datasets report accuracy.\\n40\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nC.8\\nNATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION\\nNatural language generation, or conditional natural language generation here, refers to tasks that\\nrequire generating text based on the given information, such as tables and documents. We evaluate\\nGLM-130B on data-to-text and summarization tasks. The datasets include WebNLG 2020 (Cas-\\ntro Ferreira et al., 2020), Clean E2E NLG (Dušek et al., 2019) and WikiLingua (Scialom et al.,\\n2020) from GEM generation benchmark (Gehrmann et al., 2021). We select full WebNLG 2020\\nand the Clean E2E NLG in the test set and randomly select 5000 test examples from WikiLingua\\nfollowing the practice in (Chowdhery et al., 2022). Following the settings in PaLM, the prompt\\nused for the Summarization tasks is “Summarize the following article:” and the prompt used for\\nthe Data-to-Text tasks is “Verbalize:”.\\nAn exception is E2E, where we process the data using\\nthe prompt “generate-gramatically-correct-text from” provided in promptsource for GLM-130B and\\nGPT-3 175B (Davinci). All evaluations are one-shot, and the demonstration samples are randomly\\nsampled from the training set. We report the F-measure of ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) and\\nBLEURT-20 (Pu et al., 2021). We compare our model with LaMDA, GPT-3 175B (Davinci), and\\nPaLM, where the results of LaMDA and PaLM are reported by (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and we\\nevaluate GPT-3 175B (Davinci) through OpenAI API.13\\nOur results are presented in Table 16.\\nIt shows that GLM-130B has better performances than\\nLaMDA and GPT-3 (Davinci) on all tasks. In the Data-to-text task, GLM-130B performs slightly\\nworse than PaLM-540B, while in the summary task, GLM-130B has even higher ROUGE results.\\nWe also ablate GLM-130B to unidirectional to demonstrate the advantage of bidirectional attention.\\nUnidirectional GLM-130B underperforms GPT-3 175B in all three datasets, but when it shifts to\\nbidirectional attention, there is an instant boost, making GLM-130B even comparable to PaLM-\\n540B in a few cases. It indicates that bidirectional attention over the provided context (i.e., prefix)\\ncan also be beneficial for text generation missions.\\nTable 16: 1-shot GEM English natural language generation tasks (WebNLG, E2E, and WikiLingua).\\nWe compare two versions of GLM-130B (uni: unidirectional attention, bi: bidirectional attention),\\nshowing that bidirectional attention can also improve conditional generation’s performance.\\nTask\\nDataset\\nMetric\\nLaMDA\\n137B\\nGPT-3 175B\\n(Davinci)\\nGLM-130B\\nPaLM-540B\\nuni\\nbi\\nData\\nto\\nText\\nWebNLG\\nROUGE-2\\n30.5\\n29.9\\n25.3\\n38.5\\n44.4\\nROUGE-L\\n-\\n41.2\\n36.7\\n49.3\\n53.8\\nBLEURT-20\\n-\\n59.0\\n53.2\\n67.7\\n73.9\\nE2E\\nROUGE-2\\n29.2\\n30.3\\n30.9\\n33.9\\n35.2\\nROUGE-L\\n-\\n39.2\\n40.0\\n42.6\\n43.9\\nBLEURT-20\\n-\\n64.5\\n65.0\\n68.1\\n69.7\\nSummary\\nWikiLingua\\nROUGE-2\\n5.4\\n7.2\\n5.8\\n10.4\\n9.9\\nROUGE-L\\n-\\n18.9\\n16.4\\n23.4\\n20.6\\nBLEURT-20\\n-\\n41.2\\n39.4\\n45.0\\n47.7\\n(E2E Example, without demonstration sample)\\nAleksandr_Prudnikov , height , 185.0 (centimetres).\\nFC_Spartak_Moscow , ground , Otkrytiye_Arena.\\nAleksandr_Prudnikov , club , FC_Spartak_Moscow.\\nVerbalize:\\nGroundtruth: 185 centimetre tall Aleksandr Prudnikov played for the Otkrytiye Arena based FC Spartak,\\nMoscow.\\nGPT-3 175B (Davinci): Aleksandr Prudnikov is a midfielder for FC Spartak Moscow, a football (soccer) club\\nbased in Moscow, Russia.\\nGLM-130B: Aleksandr Prudnikov is 185.0 cm tall and plays for FC Spartak Moscow.\\n13We use ROUGE implementation at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/rouge\\nand BLEURT-20 implementation at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/rouge,\\nwhose checkpoint is available at https://storage.googleapis.com/bleurt-oss-21/BLEURT-20.zip\\n41\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n(E2E Example, without demonstration sample)\\nCombine all of the following data into a concise and grammatically\\ncorrect text:\\nname : Blue Spice\\neatType : coffee shop\\narea : riverside\\nGroundtruth: At the riverside, there is a coffee shop called The Blue Spice.\\nGPT-3 175B (Davinci): Blue Spice is a riverside coffee shop which is located on the corner of River Street\\nand Riverbank Street.\\nGLM-130B: There’s a coffee shop that serves coffee in the riverside area, Blue Spice.\\n(WikiLingua Example, without demonstration sample)\\nThe majority of your customers will search for you online, so it\\'s\\nessential to have a user-friendly website.

Since in MIP, we have included the Winogrande (Sakaguchi\\net al., 2021) and SuperGLUE WSC (Wang et al., 2019), here we test on Winogender (Rudinger et al.,\\n2018) and Winograd273 (Levesque et al., 2012). For Winogender, GPT-3’s results are acquired from\\nOpenAI API, and BLOOM’s 1-shot result is evaluated by ourselves. For Winograd273, since exist-\\ning works (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022) show that 1-shot learning brings almost no\\nimprovement, we only test the zero-shot result. Another thing to notice is that, despite GPT-style\\nmodels (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM) adopting the “partial evaluation” described in (Radford et al., 2019),\\nwe find the prompt “<sentence> The \"<pronoun>\" refers to [MASK]” is better for\\nGLM-130B and adopt it in the evaluation.\\nThe results are presented in Table 17. GLM-130B performs the best across all evaluated LLM on\\nWinogender, and marginally poorer than GPT-3 and PaLM on Winograd273.\\nC.10\\nCLOSED-BOOK QUESTION ANSWERING\\nClosed-book question answering (CBQA) (Roberts et al., 2020) is a widely adopted task to evaluate\\nlanguage models’ memorization of factual knowledge, on contrary to the traditional “open-book”\\nevaluation. As we have included TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and WebQuestions (Berant et al.,\\n2013) in the MIP training, here we choose Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Strat-\\negyQA (Geva et al., 2021) as the evaluation datasets for CBQA.\\nThe results are presented in Table 18. GLM-130B performs relatively poorer on Natural Questions\\nand performs well on StrategyQA. GLM-130B’s underperformance on Natural Questions, we spec-\\nulate, potentially derives from the insufficiency fitting on English corpora, as it roughly only viewed\\n43\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n200B English tokens and thus does not memorize the detailed knowledge very well. Since CBQA\\nseems to be a task that especially stresses memorization, as is indicated by Chinchilla (Hoffmann\\net al., 2022)’s a strong performance, we think with sufficient training later, GLM-130B can perform\\nbetter.\\nC.11\\nCOMMONSENSE REASONING\\nHere we evaluate GLM-130B and some other LLMs on commonsense reasoning abilities. As we\\nhave included PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), ARC (Clark et al., 2018), and OpenbookQA (Mihaylov\\net al., 2018) in the MIP training, we select another two widely adopted commonsense reasoning\\ndatasets in our evaluation: Commonsense QA (Talmor et al., 2019) and Multiple-choice Temporal\\nCommonsense (MC-TACO, Zhou et al. (2019)). For Commonsense QA, we test the GPT-3 via\\nOpenAI Davinci API, BLOOM-176B via its Huggingface Implementation, and GLM-130B using\\nthe prompt “answer_given_question_without_options” from promptsource (Bach et al., 2022). For\\nStrategyQA, we follow the EM computation method provided in (Zhou et al., 2019).\\nThe results are shown in Table 19. As we can see, GLM-130B performs the best on both Com-\\nmonsense QA and MC-TACO across evaluated LLMs, demonstrating that GLM-130B has a good\\ngrasp of commonsense knowledge. OPT’s results are not included due to the reason described in\\nAppendix C.3.\\nC.12\\nFIXED LABEL DATASETS: A CASE STUDY IN NATURAL LANGUAGE INFERENCE\\nAs is discussed in Section 5, we adopt a rather strict criterion for selecting datasets for zero/few-shot\\nlearning in GLM-130B’s evaluation due to the use of MIP. Nevertheless, the criterion significantly\\nreduces the dataset we could currently evaluate, and especially some readers have doubted whether\\nthe restriction of not evaluating on MIP-seen fixed-label datasets is necessary (e.g., natural language\\ninference (NLI)), and suggest that we may report them in an independent section to avoid confusion.\\nFrankly speaking, in such a setting GLM-130B’s zero/few-shot learning could be quite advanta-\\ngeous. Below, we take NLI as a typical example to show GLM-130B’s outperformance in the\\nscenarios. We include 6 widely-used NLI datasets–which are not incorporated in GLM-130B’s MIP\\ntraining, as the benchmarks. The results are presented in Table 20, which shows that GLM-130B’s\\n“zero-shot” performance could be much better due to the seen task type.\\nTable 20: “Zero-shot” results of GLM-130B on 6 typical natural language inference (NLI) datasets.\\n∗DISCLAIMER: Despite the datasets are never seen, some other NLI datasets have been in-\\ncluded in GLM-130B’s MIP, making it different from the existing standard zero-shot setting.\\nBLOOM 176B\\nOPT 175B\\nGLM-130B∗\\nqnli (valid, median of 5 prompts)\\n50.9\\n55.4\\n86.7\\nmnli (valid, median of 15 prompts)\\n35.5\\n36.0\\n85.7\\nmnli_mismatched (valid, median of 15 prompts)\\n35.5\\n36.0\\n84.6\\nwnli (valid, median of 5 prompts)\\n57.7\\n53.5\\n67.6\\nglue/cola (valid, median of 5 prompts)\\n39.0\\n44.4\\n57.6\\nglue/mrpc (valid, median of 5 prompts)\\n31.6\\n44.6\\n87.3\\nC.13\\nSUPERGLUE\\nWe also report our evaluation of GLM-130B on the SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark,\\nwhich consists 8 different natural language understanding challenges.\\nNoted that these results\\nare neither zero/few-shot nor fine-tuned results, because 7 out of 8 tasks’ training sets have been\\nincluded in GLM-130B’s MIP training (except for ReCoRD) together with other 67 multi-task\\ndatasets; however, GLM-130B is also not individually fine-tuned on any of them.

For some of the tasks (such as\\nCB, MultiRC, RTE, COPA, and BoolQ), GLM-130B can even achieve over 80% accuracy.\\nWe also attempted to fine-tune GLM-130B on the SuperGLUE dataset. However, we encountered\\nthe issue of rapid overfitting within a single epoch when we used full parameter fine-tuning on\\ndownstream tasks. This resulted in poor performance on the validation set. To address this issue,\\nwe explored the use of efficient parameter fine-tuning methods, which tune only a small number\\nof parameters and are less prone to overfitting. After experimenting with several methods, we use\\nP-Tuning v2 (Liu et al., 2022), which demonstrated comparable results to full parameter fine-tuning\\nin GLM-130B, but with only 0.1% to 3% of tuned parameters.

These tasks’ performance grows logarithmically\\nwith the amount of GLM parameters. Most of traditional NLP tasks fall into the same pattern.\\nLast letter concatenation (LLC). The task asks the model to concatenate the last letters of words\\nin a name (e.g., \"Elon Musk\" -> \"nk\"). We generate full names by randomly concatenating the top\\n1000 first and last names from name census data14.\\nCoin flip. This task asks the model to answer whether a coin is still heads up after people either\\nflip or don’t flip it beginning from being heads up. (e.g., \"A coin is heads up. Phoebe flips the coin.\\nOsvaldo does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?\" -> \"no\"). We additionally evaluate on\\nthe scenario where the number of people in the query examples is larger than that in the in-context\\nexamples, i.e. the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting.\\nReverse List. This task asks the model to reverse the order of a list of everyday objects (e.g.,\\n\"cigar, umbrella, key, gum, alarm\" -> \"alarm, gum, key, umbrella, cigar\"). We generate the lists by\\nrandomly sampling from the vocabulary of everyday objects15.\\nSports. This task asks the model to judge the truthfulness of a statement about a sports player (e.g.,\\n\"Joao Moutinho caught the screen pass in the NFC championship\" -> \"false\").\\nDate. This task asks the model to infer the data from a given context (e.g., \"2015 is coming in 36\\nhours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?\" -> \"01/05/2015\").\\nWe use the same examples and chains as Wei et al. (2022c). For each task, we try two different\\nformats of prompts and both unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanism and report the\\nbest performance. The first format is \"Question: {context} Answer: {target}\". The second one is\\nto add serial numbers before examples in the first format of prompts. The results are presented in\\nFigure 18.\\nD\\nSCALING AND EMERGENT ABILITIES IN GLM-130B\\nScaling up pre-trained language models has been proven to boost downstream performance on a\\nwide range of tasks continually. His, emergent abilities which are unpredictable from smaller scales.\\nTo illustrate this, we conducted extensive experiments to explore the scaling property and emergent\\nabilities. Following prior literature (Wei et al., 2022b), we categorize the NLP tasks into two types\\nbased on our observations.\\n• Log-scaling Ability Tasks (Cf. Figure 19): where the task performance grows logarithmically\\nwith the number of model parameters. Typical tasks and datasets include LAMBADA, Wikitext-\\n103, Wikitext-2, Penn Tree Bank.\\n• Emergent Ability Tasks (Cf. Figure 20): where the task performance only soars up when the\\namount of model parameters reaches a certain threshold. Typical tasks and datasets include:\\n14https://namecensus.com\\n15https://www.vocabulary.com/lists/189583\\n46\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nEmergent Ability Tasks\\nFigure 20: Emergent ability tasks of GLM-130B. These tasks’ performance does not grow much\\nuntil the model size reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 100B or 10B). After reaching the threshold, the\\nmodel performance soars up quickly. The BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) benchmark collects\\nmany of these challenges.\\nMMLU, hindu_knowledge, crass_ai, implicatures, understanding_fables, modified_arithmetic,\\nimplicit_relations, and gre_reading_comprehension from BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022).\\nIn line with the observation in (Wei et al., 2022b), we show that GLM-130B also presents the two\\nsimilar scaling behaviors to other LLMs such as GPT-3, LaMDA, and PaLM. Though why and how\\nLLMs present these intriguing properties remain unclear, GLM-130B provides open opportunities\\nfor all researchers to test and understand the reason behind them.\\n47\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nTable 11: Full configurations for GLM-130B training\\nConfiguration Key\\nValue\\nadam_beta1\\n0.9\\nadam_beta2\\n0.95\\nadam_eps\\n1e-08\\naggregated_samples_per_sequence\\n4\\nattention_dropout\\n0.1\\nattention_softmax_in_fp32\\nTrue\\naverage_block_length\\n3\\nbias_dropout_fusion\\nTrue\\ncheckpoint_activations\\nTrue\\ncheckpoint_in_cpu\\nFalse\\ncheckpoint_num_layers\\n1\\nclip_grad\\n1.0\\ncontigious_checkpointing\\nFalse\\ncpu_optimizer\\nFalse\\ndata_parallel_size\\n24\\ndeepnorm\\nTrue\\ndistributed_backend\\nnccl\\neval_interval\\n1000\\neval_iters\\n3\\nffn_hidden_size\\n32768\\nfp16\\nTrue\\nglobal_batch_size\\n4224\\nglu_activation\\ngeglu\\ngpt_prob\\n0.7\\nhidden_dropout\\n0.1\\nhidden_size\\n12288\\nhysteresis\\n2\\ninit_method_std\\n0.0052\\ninit_method_xavier_uniform\\nFalse\\ninitial_loss_scale\\n65536\\nlayernorm_epsilon\\n1E-05\\nlearnable_rotary_embedding\\nFalse\\nlength_per_sample\\n2000\\nlog_interval\\n1\\nloss_scale\\n0\\nloss_scale_window\\n2000\\nlr\\n8e-05\\nlr_decay_iters\\nNone\\nlr_decay_samples\\n197753905\\nlr_decay_style\\ncosine\\nlr_warmup_samples\\n1098632\\nmake_vocab_size_divisible_by\\n768\\nmask_prob\\n0.15\\nmasked_softmax_fusion\\nTrue\\nmicro_batch_size\\n1\\nmin_gmask_ratio\\n0.2\\nmin_loss_scale\\n1.0\\nmin_lr\\n8e-06\\nmultitask_ratio\\n0.05\\nnum_attention_heads\\n96\\nnum_layers\\n70\\nonnx_safe\\nNone\\noptimizer\\nadam\\npartition_activations\\nTrue\\npipeline_model_parallel_size\\n8\\nposition_embedding_type\\nrotary\\nrampup_batch_size\\n192, 24, 5493164\\nsave_interval\\n250\\nseed\\n1234\\nseq_length\\n2048\\nshort_seq_prob\\n0.02\\nshrink_embedding_gradient_alpha\\n0.1\\nsingle_span_prob\\n0.02\\nsplit\\n949,50,1\\ntensor_model_parallel_size\\n4\\ntokenizer_type\\nIceTokenizer\\nweight_decay\\n0.1\\nzero_contigious_gradients\\nFalse\\nzero_reduce_bucket_size\\n500000000\\nzero_reduce_scatter\\nFalse\\nzero_stage\\n1\\nzero-optimization.allgather_bucket_size\\n500000000\\ntokenizer_type\\nIceTokenizer\\nweight_decay\\n0.1\\nworld_size\\n768\\nzero_contigious_gradients\\nFALSE\\nzero_reduce_bucket_size\\n500000000\\nzero_reduce_scatter\\nFALSE\\nzero_stage\\n1\\nzero-optimization.allgather_bucket_size\\n500000000\\n48\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nTable 12: The 74 datasets involved in Multi-task Instruction Pre-training (MIP).

Though GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the pioneer for this effort, it is not\\navailable to most people in the world. In addition, it supports English only. We therefore decide to\\ninitialize the project GLM-130B. Please note that the WuDao 1.75T model we built last year is a\\nsparse model with 480 mixture-of-experts (MoE), rather than a dense one as GPT-3. Our goal then\\nis to train a bilingual pre-trained dense model with high accuracy on downstream tasks, and to make\\nit open to everyone in the world-anyone, anywhere can download it and use it on a single server with\\nappropriate GPUs.\\nThe ambitious project soon faced several important challenges:\\n• Lack of computational resources: No organization is willing to sponsor such a big project and\\nfreely make it public.\\n• Lack of a robust pre-training algorithm: Despite GPT-3’s success on English corpus, it is\\nunclear how to train a high-accurate bilingual model for both English and Chinese.\\n• Lack of fast inference solutions: Since the goal is to have the model public to everyone, we need\\nto design fast inference solutions with low resource requirements to run the model.\\nFor the pre-training algorithm, we finally chose GLM (Du et al., 2022) due to its high performance\\nin practice. We eventually decided to train a GLM model of 130 billion parameters after several\\nrounds of discussions and exploration, because such a size makes it possible to run the inference on\\na single A100 (40G * 8) server.\\nOur first attempt at training the model was in January 2022, shortly after we received a small sponsor\\nof GPUs for test running. However, we soon realized that we had significantly underestimated the\\ntechnical difficulties of pre-training a model at such a scale (>100B). It seems that pre-training a\\nhighly accurate 100B-scale model is quite different from training a 10B-scale one. Due to frequent\\nrandom hardware failures, model gradients exploding, unexpected excessive memory usage in the\\nalgorithm, debug for the 3D pipeline in the new Megatron and DeepSpeed frameworks, inability to\\nrecover from optimizer states, blocked TCP responses between processes, and many many unex-\\npected “bugs”, the project was delayed for many times. The Tsinghua PACMAN team gave us a\\nhand at this difficult time and together we successfully fixed most of the “bugs”.\\nBy March, we were still short on computational resources, but fortunately got a chance to try test\\nruns on several other platforms, including Ascend 910, Hygon DCU, NVIDIA, and Sunway. The\\nimmediate challenge was for us to adapt our training code to these different platforms, as the under-\\nlying operators are quite different. Also, it introduced many new issues: the element-wise operators\\nnot supporting fast computation for large-dimension vectors, various issues that hindered conver-\\ngence—the large gradient norms of input embeddings, native Post-LN, Pre-LN, and Sandwich-LN,\\ndataloader state seeds, and computation precision choices in Softmax and Attention — as well as\\nnumerous mistakes we ourselves made. With tremendous help from all of our generous partners, we\\nfinally succeeded in making our pre-training algorithms runnable across all the platforms—frankly,\\na surprising achievement for this project. The timeline of GLM-130B in Figure 21 covers most of\\nthe issues we have encountered and addressed as of this writing.\\nOn April 26th, we received a generous computing sponsorship from Zhipu.AI — an AI startup that\\naims to teach machines to think like humans. After another week of testing, we finally kicked off\\nthe training of the GLM-130B model on its 96 A100 (40G * 8) servers on May 6th. Additionally,\\nZhipu.AI also sent a team to help evaluate the pre-trained model and build a demonstration website.\\nThe training period spanned two months, during which we began developing a toolkit to allow GLM-\\n130B’s inference in low-resource setting with swapping technique and quantization.

We will attempt to further reduce\\nthe resource requirements and keep the community updated on this important working item.\\nG\\nBROADER IMPACT\\nThis paper introduces an open bilingual pre-trained language model with 130 billion parameters.\\nCurrently most pre-trained language models with over 100 billion parameters are privately owned\\nby governments and large corporations (Brown et al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021;\\nChowdhery et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021). A few of them (Brown et al., 2020; Lieber et al., 2021)\\nprovide limited inference APIs with fees. In contrast, the weights and code of GLM-130B are open\\nto anyone who is interested in LLMs. Moreover, we significantly lower the hardware requirements\\nfor inference by speed-up implementation and INT4 quantization. The paper can have a broader\\nimpact on the research community, individual developers and small companies, and society.\\nG.1\\nIMPACT ON AI RESEARCH\\nMost research institutions cannot afford the substantial cost of pretraining large language models.\\nAs a result, most researchers, except employees of governments and large corporations, only have\\naccess to the limited inference APIs with fees. With the inference APIs, researchers can only analyze\\nthe outputs of models as black boxes, which limits the scope of potential work. With GLM-130B,\\nresearchers can analyze the model parameters and internal states corresponding to specific inputs,\\nleading to in-depth studies of LLMs’ theory, capacity, and flaws. Researchers can also modify the\\nmodel architecture and weights, to validate the proposed algorithms to improve LLMs Zhu et al.\\n(2020); Cao et al. (2021); Hase et al. (2021); Mitchell et al. (2022).\\nWith INT4 quantization, GLM-130B can perform inference on popularized GPUs such as 4 × RTX\\n3090 or 8 × RTX 2080 Ti, which can be easily accessed from cloud service. As a result, researchers\\nwho cannot afford powerful data-center GPU servers like DGX-A100 can also utilize GLM-130B.\\nG.2\\nIMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPERS AND SMALL COMPANIES\\nCurrently, individual developers and small companies who want to integrate LLMs into their busi-\\nness can only choose paid inference APIs. The increased cost can hinder their attempts. Instead,\\nGLM-130B can be deployed on popularized hardware that they own or can access via cloud service\\nto reduce the cost. Furthermore, they can utilize distillation techniques Sanh et al. (2019); Jiao et al.\\n(2020) to obtain smaller models that preserve comparable performance on their specific tasks. While\\nsome developers may lack the ability to complete deployment and distillation on their own, we be-\\nlieve with GLM-130B and more open LLMs in the future, the corresponding toolkits and service\\nproviders will become more available.\\nWe also note that currently most applications of LLMs are based on prompt engineering, partly\\ndue to the limitation of inference APIs. In downstream scenarios such as online customer service,\\nthe companies accumulate huge amounts of human-generated data that contain domain knowledge.\\nWith the open-source weights and code, developers can finetune GLM-130B on their own data to\\nmitigate the gap of domain knowledge.\\nG.3\\nSOCIAL IMPACT\\nLarge language models, together with other machine learning models in different modalities (e.g.,\\nImage (Ramesh et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2021; Saharia et al.) and Video (Hong et al., 2022)), could\\nbe used to generate synthetic text for harmful applications, such as telemarketing fraud, political\\npropaganda, and personal harassment as is discussed in (Weidinger et al., 2021; Sheng et al., 2021;\\nDev et al., 2021). We do not anticipate any hazardous outputs, especially towards vulnerable and\\nhistorically disadvantaged groups of people, after using the model.\\nWhile some people think that restricting access to LLMs can prevent such harmful applications, we\\nargue that promoting LLM inclusivity can lead to better defense against potential harm caused by\\n55\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nLLMs. Currently, only governments and large corporations can afford the considerable costs of pre-\\ntraining LLMs. There is no guarantee that organizations having the substantial financial resources\\nto pretrain an LLM will not do harm with it. Without access to such LLMs, individuals cannot\\neven realize the role of LLMs in harm. Conversely, releasing an open LLM can provide access and\\ntransparency to all the researchers and promote the research to reduce the potential harm of LLMs,\\nlike algorithms to identify the synthetic text Gehrmann et al. (2019) or detect fake news Li et al.\\n(2021).\\nAlso, it is known that LLMs can suffer from problems in fairness, bias, privacy, and truthful-\\nness Zhang et al. (2021); Lin et al. (2022); Liang et al. (2021); Bender et al. (2021). An open\\nLLM can reveal the model parameters and internal states corresponding to specific inputs instead\\nof providing APIs to black-box models. In conclusion, researchers can conduct analysis of LLMs’\\nflaws in depth and propose improved algorithms to solve the problems.\\nH\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\\nOne of the major concerns about large language models is their huge energy usage and associated\\ncarbon emissions Strubell et al. (2019); Lacoste et al. (2019); Patterson et al. (2021); Bender et al.\\n(2021). GPT-3 was estimated to use 500 tons of carbon emissions footprint (CO2eq) Patterson et al.\\n(2021). We consumed a total of 442.4MWh of electricity over the 60-day course of training. Given\\nthe 0.5810 kg/kWh carbon efficiency of local power grid, the pre-training released 257.01 metric\\ntons of CO2. This is around half of GPT-3’s carbon footprint, probably due to the efficient parallel\\nstrategies and NVIDIA’s hardware improvements. The carbon emission is roughly the equivalent of\\nthe yearly emissions of 18 average Americans. However, we believe that with GLM-130B released,\\nmore carbon emissions for reproducing 100B-scale LLMs can be saved.\\n56\\n'},\n",

Po-\\ntential candidates of incorrect answers were mas-\\nsively oversampled from a language model trained\\non in-domain data, and then selected using an en-\\nsemble of adversaries. The selection process hap-\\npens iteratively: on each iteration, the dataset is\\nrandomly partitioned into Dtrain and Dtest. The\\nensemble is trained to classify endings as real or\\ngenerated on Dtrain, then, AF replaces easy-to-\\nclassify generations in Dtest. This process con-\\ntinues until the accuracy of these adversaries con-\\nverges.

Endings were generated via a language\\nmodel, and then selected to fool a discrimina-\\ntor.\\nTo understand why it was solved requires\\nunderstanding the interplay of AF with respect to\\nSWAG’s generators and discriminators.\\nZellers et al. (2018) used a two-layer LSTM for\\ngeneration, with shallow stylistic adversarial ﬁl-\\nters.6 This setup was robust against ELMo mod-\\nels, but has the shallow LM in particular produced\\ndistributional artifacts that BERT picks up on?\\n6The discriminator was an ensemble that featured a bag\\nof words model, a shallow CNN, a multilayer perceptron op-\\nerating on language model perplexities.\\nTo investigate this, we perform AF using BERT-\\nLarge as the discriminator7 in two settings, com-\\nparing generations from Zellers et al. (2018) with\\nthose from a ﬁnetuned GPT (Radford et al., 2018).\\nStrikingly, the results, Figure 5 (left), show that\\nthe generations used in SWAG are so diﬀerent\\nfrom the human-written endings that AF never\\ndrops the accuracy to chance; instead, it converges\\nto roughly 75%. On the other hand, GPT’s gener-\\nations are good enough that BERT accuracy drops\\nbelow 30% over many random subsplits of the\\ndata, revealing the importance of the generator.\\n4\\nHellaSwag\\nThe success of BERT implies that high-quality\\ngenerators and discriminators are crucial to AF’s\\nsuccess. However, it does not imply that the un-\\nderlying task of commonsense NLI – as opposed\\nto a single dataset – is solved. To evaluate this\\nclaim requires us to try making a new evolution\\nof the SWAG dataset, one in which artifacts are\\nremoved.

In all cases, BERT per-\\nformance begins high (70-90%), but there are\\nenough generations for Adversarial Filtering to\\nlower the ﬁnal accuracy considerably. While the\\none-sentence case converges to slightly higher\\nthan random – 35% when it converges – the two\\nand three sentence cases are higher, at 40% and\\n50% respectively. Given more context, it becomes\\neasier to classify an ending as machine- or human-\\nwritten.\\nWe compromise and use two-sentence\\ngenerations. Particularly in the two-sentence case,\\nwe ﬁnd ourselves in a Goldilocks zone wherein\\ngenerations are challenging for deep models, yet\\nas we shall soon see, easy for humans.\\n4.3\\nObtaining high human agreement\\nHow well can humans distinguish human-written\\nendings from machine generations reﬁned with\\nAdversarial Filtering?\\nIn Figure 6, we com-\\npare human performance with that of BERT on\\na random 80%/20% split.\\nWe see a contrast\\nbetween the ActivityNet and WikiHow perfor-\\nmance.\\nWhile ActivityNet starts oﬀharder for\\nBERT (25.5%), it also proves diﬃcult for humans\\n(60%).\\nIn contrast, WikiHow starts easier for\\nBERT (41.1%) and humans ﬁnd the domain al-\\nmost trivial (93.5%). We hypothesis this discrep-\\nancy is due to the lengths of both datasets (Fig-\\nure 7). WikiHow’s 2-sentence generations average\\n41 tokens, versus 13 for ActivityNet.

The models share the same for-\\nmat: given a context and an ending, return a logit\\nfor that ending. Accordingly, we train our models\\nusing a four-way cross-entropy loss, where the ob-\\njective is to predict the correct ending. In addition\\nto BERT-Large, our comparisons include:\\na. OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018): A ﬁne-\\ntuned 12-layer transformer that was pre-trained on\\nthe BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015).\\nb.

ESIM+ELMo (Chen et al., 2017; Peters et al.,\\n2018): This is the best-performing ELMo model\\nfor NLI, modiﬁed slightly so the ﬁnal output layer\\nis now a four-way softmax over endings.\\nd.

Surprisingly, despite BERT-\\nLarge having been used as the adversarial ﬁlter,\\nit still performs the strongest at 47.3% overall.\\nBy making the dataset adversarial for BERT, it\\nseems to also have become adversarial for every\\nother model.

In Figure 9 we show the results from\\ntransfer experiments: models are trained on one\\ndataset and evaluated on the other.11\\nThe best models are trained on the same\\ndataset that they are evaluated on: training on\\nSWAG and evaluating on HellaSwag lowers per-\\nformance by 12%; vice versa lowers performance\\nby 15%.

The question still\\nremains, though, of where will the ﬁeld go next?\\n6.1\\nHow easy might HellaSwag be for future\\ndiscriminators?\\nIn this paper, we showed the existence of a\\nGoldilocks zone of text complexity – in which\\ngenerations are nonsensical, but existing state-\\nof-the-art NLP models cannot tell the diﬀerence.\\nHow hard will the dataset be for future, even more\\npowerful, models?\\nAnswering this question is challenging because\\nthese models don’t exist (or are unavailable) at\\nthe time of writing. However, one remedy is to\\nperform an ablation study on the Adversarial Fil-\\ntering model used, comparing weaker ﬁlters with\\nstronger discriminators.\\nWe present our results\\nin Figure 11, and ﬁnd that while weak discrim-\\ninators (like the stylistic ensemble used to make\\nSWAG) only marginally reduce the accuracy of\\nBERT-Large, increasing the gap between the ﬁlter\\nand the ﬁnal discriminator is not enough to solve\\nthe task. For instance, using a discriminator with\\n3x the parameters as the adversarial ﬁlter (BERT-\\nLarge vs. BERT-Base) results in 63% machine ac-\\ncuracy.\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\n100\\nOverall Accuracy on HellaSwag\\n10\\n2\\n10\\n4\\n10\\n6\\n10\\n8\\n10\\n10\\nPretraining Hours (Estimate)\\nHuman performance?\\nELMo\\nGPT\\nBERT-Base\\nBERT-Large\\nFigure 12:\\nEstimated pretraining hours required to\\nreach a desired accuracy on HellaSwag. We estimate\\nperfomance with respect to a RTX 2080 Ti - a modern,\\nfast GPU, and ﬁt a log-linear regression line. An ex-\\ntrapolation suggests that to reach human-level perfor-\\nmance on HellaSwag, without algorithmic or computa-\\ntional improvements, would require 109 GPU-hours of\\npretraining (over 100k GPU years).\\n6.2\\nHow well does pretraining scale?\\nOverall, the current paradigm of pretraining large\\nmodels on lots of data has made immense progress\\non NLP benchmarks.\\nThough we expect this\\ntrend to continue, it also behooves us to con-\\nsider its limits.\\nIf more compute is indeed the\\nanswer for human-level commonsense inference,\\nwhat would the compute requirements of this hy-\\npothetical massive model look like?\\nWe investigate this in Figure 12 by compar-\\ning the accuracies of known models on Hella-\\nSwag with their computational needs. This estima-\\ntion is a rough estimate: we convert reported TPU\\nruntimes to our benchmark RTX 2080 Ti GPU us-\\ning the Rooﬂine model (Williams et al., 2009),\\nwhich focuses primarily on the bottleneck of load-\\ning tensors into GPU memory. Extrapolating from\\nan exponential ﬁt suggests that reaching human-\\nlevel performance on our dataset would require\\n109 GPU hours, or 100k years – unless algorith-\\nmic improvements are made.\\nWhat might these algorithmic improvements\\nlook like? These could include architectural ad-\\nvances, better pretraining objectives, and beyond.\\nHowever, these improvements share the bottle-\\nneck of the data source. To answer some Hella-\\nSwag questions correctly without reasoning deeply\\n– like knowing that it is a bad idea to stop at a\\nred light for ‘at most two seconds’ – might require\\nan exponential number of samples, due to prob-\\n8\\nlems of reporting bias (Gordon and Van Durme,\\n2013). Alternatively, future models might answer\\ncorrectly only by picking up on spurious patterns,\\nin which case a new development of the bench-\\nmark – using these models as adversaries – would\\nplace us in the same position as we are right now.\\nPut another way, for humans to answer Hella-\\nSwag questions requires abstracting away from\\nlanguage and modeling world states instead. We\\npostulate that this is what separates solving the\\ntask of commonsense NLI, as opposed to a par-\\nticular dataset. Indeed, we ﬁnd that existing deep\\nmethods often get fooled by lexical false friends.\\nFor example, in the WikiHow example from Fig-\\nure 10, BERT chooses an ending that matches\\nthe technology words in the context, rather than\\nmatching the deeper topic: using technology as an\\nexcuse for not doing homework.\\n6.3\\nTowards a future of evolving benchmarks\\nWhat happens when HellaSwag gets solved? We\\nbelieve the answer is simple: crowdsource another\\ndataset, with the same exact format, and see where\\nmodels fail. Indeed, in our work we found this to\\nbe straightforward from an algorithmic perspec-\\ntive: by throwing in the best known generator\\n(GPT) and the best known discriminator (BERT-\\nLarge), we made a dataset that is adversarial - not\\njust to BERT, but to all models we have access to.\\nWhile this was easy algorithmically, care must\\nbe taken from a data curation standpoint. Indeed,\\nwe ﬁnd success exists within a Goldilocks zone:\\nthe data source must be complex enough that state-\\nof-the-art generators often make mistakes, while\\nsimple enough such that discriminators often fail\\nto catch them.\\nThis ties the future of SWAG-\\nstyle benchmarks to progress on language gener-\\nation: until generation is solved, commonsense\\nNLI will remain unsolved. Even recent promis-\\ning results on scaling up language models (Rad-\\nford et al., 2019) ﬁnd problems in terms of consis-\\ntency, with the best curated examples requiring 25\\nrandom seeds.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented HellaSwag, a new\\ndataset for physically situated commonsense rea-\\nsoning. By constructing the dataset through ad-\\nversarial ﬁltering, combined with state-of-the-art\\nmodels for language generation and discrimina-\\ntion, we produced a dataset that is adversarial to\\nthe most robust models available – even when\\nmodels are evaluated on items from the train-\\ning distribution.\\nIn turn, we provided insight\\ninto the inner workings of pretrained models, and\\nsuggest a path for NLP progress going forward:\\ntowards benchmarks that adversarially co-evolve\\nwith evolving state-of-the-art models.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank the reviewers, as well as Jesse Thoma-\\nson, for their helpful feedback.\\nWe thank the\\nMechanical Turk workers for their great work\\nduring dataset collection.\\nThanks also to Zak\\nStone and the Google Cloud TPU team for help\\nwith the computing infrastructure.\\nThis work\\nwas supported by the National Science Foundation\\nthrough a Graduate Research Fellowship (DGE-\\n1256082) and NSF grants (IIS-1524371, 1637479,\\n165205, 1703166), the DARPA CwC program\\nthrough ARO (W911NF-15-1-0543), the IARPA\\nDIVA program through D17PC00343, the Sloan\\nResearch Foundation through a Sloan Fellowship,\\nthe Allen Institute for Artiﬁcial Intelligence, the\\nNVIDIA Artiﬁcial Intelligence Lab, and gifts by\\nGoogle and Facebook.\\nThe views and conclu-\\nsions contained herein are those of the authors and\\nshould not be interpreted as representing endorse-\\nments of IARPA, DOI/IBC, or the U.S. Govern-\\nment.\\nReferences\\nYonatan Belinkov and Yonatan Bisk. 2018.

(2018). Details:\\na. On each iteration, we split the dataset up into\\n80% training and 20% testing. We don’t do\\nanything special for this split (like looking at\\nthe video/article IDs).\\nb. For ActivityNet, we use k “ 9 assigned in-\\ndices for every example. (This corresponds to\\nthe number of red columns in Figure 2). For\\nWikiHow, we used k “ 5, since we found\\nthat there were fewer good endings produced\\nby the generators after scaling up the sequence\\nlength.\\nc.\\nSimilarly to Zellers et al. (2018), we train the\\nAF models in a multi-way fashion.\\nSince\\nwe use BERT-Large as the discriminator, this\\nmatches Devlin et al. (2018)’s model for\\nSWAG: on each training example, the model\\nis given exactly one positive ending and sev-\\neral negative endings, and the model com-\\nputes probability distribution over the endings\\nthrough a softmax. However, we also wanted\\nto always report 4-way probability for simplic-\\nity. To do this, we train in a 4-way setting (the\\ntraining set is constructed by subsampling 3\\nwrong answers from the set of k that are cur-\\nrently assigned to each example). The accu-\\nracy values that are reported are done so using\\nthe ﬁrst 3 assigned negatives in dataset Dtest.\\nd. Sometimes, BERT never converges (accuracy\\naround 25%), so when this happens, we don’t\\ndo the reassignment.\\nB\\nGPT Setup\\nWe generate our dataset examples from OpenAI\\nGPT. We ﬁnetune the model for two epochs on\\nWikiHow, and 5 epochs on ActivityNet, using the\\ndefault learning rate of (Radford et al., 2018). Im-\\nportantly, we generate randomly according to the\\nlanguage model distribution, rather than perform-\\ning beam search – this would bias the genera-\\ntions towards common words. For the WikiHow\\nendings, we used Nucleus Sampling with p “\\n0.98, which means that the probability weights for\\nthe tail (those tokens with cumulative probabil-\\nity mass ă 0.02) are zeroed out (Holtzman et al.,\\n2019).\\nC\\nBERT setup\\nWe extensively study BERT in this paper, and\\nmake no changes to the underlying architecture or\\npretraining. For all of the experiments where we\\nprovide context, we set up the input to the BERT\\nmodel like this:\\n[CLS] A woman is outside with a bucket and\\na dog.\\nThe dog is running around trying to\\navoid a bath.\\n[SEP] She gets the dog wet,\\nthen it runs away again [SEP]\\nIn the case where only the ending is pro-\\nvided, we adopt the BERT-style ‘single-span’ set-\\nting:\\n[CLS] She gets the dog wet, then it runs\\naway again [SEP]\\nD\\nA discussion on BERT\\nHyperparameters and Instability\\nIt is worth noting that many of our experiments\\nsome instability. On the SWAG experiments, we\\nuse the same hyperparameters as (Devlin et al.,\\n2018) - these generally work very well.13 How-\\never, we ﬁnd that they become a bit unstable when\\ncrossing over to make HellaSwag. Here, we dis-\\ncuss some strategies and insight that we picked up\\non.\\na. We use a batch size of 64 examples rather\\nthan 16, and warm the model up for 20% of\\nthe dataset (rather than 10%). This helps the\\nmodel adapt to SWAG more gradually, with-\\nout diverging early on.\\nb. For the Adversarial Filtering experiments (for\\nboth WikiHow and ActivityNet), we random-\\nize some of the hyperaparmeters on each it-\\neration. We sample a learning rate between\\n1e-5 and 4e-5, using a log-uniform distribu-\\ntion. These outer ranges were recommended\\nfrom the original BERT paper. Additionally,\\nwith probability 0.5 we use the cased model\\n(where the input isn’t originally lowercased\\nbefore tokenization), rather than the uncased\\nmodel.\\nc.\\nDuring adversarial ﬁltering, we used 3 epochs.\\nHowever, we found that adding more epochs\\n13The only exception is for the plots where we vary the\\nnumber of training examples. In this case, we don’t want\\nto disadvantage the trials without much training data (since\\nthis would allow for fewer parameter updates). To remedy\\nthis, we continue training for 10 epochs and report the best\\nvalidation performance over the entire training history.\\n11\\nhelped the model during ﬁne-tuning on the ﬁ-\\nnal dataset HellaSwag. Our best conﬁguration\\nuses 10 epochs.\\nd. While ﬁne-tuning on HellaSwag we used a\\nlearning rate of 2e-5.\\nE\\nHuman validation\\nWe performed human validation using the same\\nsetup as (Zellers et al., 2018). Humans get six an-\\nswers to choose from, of which exactly one is the\\ntrue ending and the other ﬁve are from AF. We\\nfound that multiple rounds of human validation\\nwere especially helpful on ActivityNet. However,\\nit helps to do the human validation in an intelli-\\ngent way: if the ﬁrst worker is confused, the an-\\nswer should be replaced before it goes to the next\\nworker. This is a hard problem, so we adopt the\\nfollowing approach:\\na. We use best practices on mechanical turk, pay-\\ning workers fairly (up to 37 cents per HIT on\\nWikiHow). We also used a qualiﬁcation HIT\\nthat was autograded to help ﬁlter for workers\\nwho are good at the task. Workers who tended\\nto prefer the generated endings over the real\\nones were dequaliﬁed from participating.\\nb. For each worker,\\nwe use the summary\\nof their performance so far to estimate\\nPpanswer i is right|worker rates i as bestq. We\\ncan then use this to estimate how conﬁdent we\\nare in each answer choice: we want to be con-\\nﬁdent that workers will not prefer the wrong\\nanswers. Also, this allows us to aggregate per-\\nformance across crowd workers, by multiply-\\ning the probabilities for each answer choice.\\nc.\\nOn each round of ﬁltering, we keep the 3\\nwrong endings that workers least prefer (based\\non the probability scores, along with the right\\nending. The other two endings are new ones.\\nParticularly on ActivityNet, we found that there\\nare some contexts where the ground truth answer\\nisn’t liked by workers. To ﬁx this, we end up tak-\\ning the best 25k examples from ActivityNet and\\nthe best 45k from WikiHow. (By best, we mean\\nthe ones with the highest probability that work-\\ners will predict the true answer, versus the three\\neasiest-to-guess negatives, as judged by the Naive\\nBayes model).\\nWe make Figure 7 (‘The road\\nto HellaSwag’) by doing this process (taking the\\nbest examples) for each dataset, while varying the\\nnumber of annotators that are used for getting the\\nscores for each ending. (In the case where there\\nare 0 annotators, we get a random sample).\\nF\\nHuman Evaluation\\nWe do a human evaluation while giving workers\\nthe exact same task as is given to the models.\\nWorkers are given ﬁve endings, and must pick the\\nbest one. We obtain human evaluation numbers by\\ncombining 5 turkers together, with a majority vote.\\nWe found that the biggest diﬀerences in diﬃ-\\nculty in humans were due to domain (WikiHow is\\neasier than ActivityNet). To account for this, we\\ndid the human evaluation over 200 examples from\\nWikiHow, and 200 examples from ActivityNet, for\\neach number of previous validators as shown in\\nFigure 7 (0, 1, or 2). To report the accuracy of a\\nsplit that’s mixed between WikiHow and Activity-\\nNet, we use the following formula:\\naccWikiHow ¨ NWikiHow ` accActivityNet ¨ NActivityNet\\nNWikiHow ` NActivityNet\\nHere, acc refers to the accuracy on each dataset as\\njudged by humans, and N is the number of exam-\\nples from that dataset in the split.\\nG\\nMore examples\\nWe additionally have more validation examples,\\nshown in Figure 2.\\nH\\nIn-Domain and Zero-Shot categories\\nSee Figure 13 for a closer look at the dataset cate-\\ngories.\\n12\\nCategory: Preparing pasta (activitynet; indomain)\\nA kitchen is shown followed by various ingredients\\nand a woman speaking to the camera.\\nShe begins\\nshowing the ingredients and putting them into a hot\\nboiling pot and stirring around. she\\na) shows oﬀthe oven and begins assembling the\\ncookies in the oven by pushing a button on the oven.\\n(2.2%)\\nb) continues mixing up more ingredients and then\\nputs them all together in a bowl, serving the dish\\nad sprinkling olive oil around it.

We release\\nall our models to the research community1.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\\n∗Equal contribution.\\nCorrespondence: {htouvron,\\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\nperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”). There exist some\\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\\nof the modiﬁcations we made to the transformer\\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\\ntraining method. We then report the performance of\\nour models and compare with others LLMs on a set\\nof standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some\\nof the biases and toxicity encoded in our models,\\nusing some of the most recent benchmarks from\\nthe responsible AI community.\\narXiv:2302.13971v1  [cs.CL]  27 Feb 2023\\n2\\nApproach\\nOur training approach is similar to the methods\\ndescribed in previous work (Brown et al., 2020;\\nChowdhery et al., 2022), and is inspired by the\\nChinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022).\\nWe train large transformers on a large quantity of\\ntextual data using a standard optimizer.\\n2.1\\nPre-training Data\\nOur training dataset is a mixture of several sources,\\nreported in Table 1, that cover a diverse set of do-\\nmains. For the most part, we reuse data sources\\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\\ncentage they represent in the training set:\\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%].\\nWe preprocess\\nﬁve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\\nline level, performs language identiﬁcation with\\na fastText linear classiﬁer to remove non-English\\npages and ﬁlters low quality content with an n-\\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\\ndiscarded pages not classiﬁed as references.\\nC4 [15%].\\nDuring exploratory experiments, we\\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\\nalso contains deduplication and language identiﬁ-\\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\\nthe quality ﬁltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\\nGithub [4.5%].\\nWe use the public GitHub\\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we ﬁltered\\nlow quality ﬁles with heuristics based on the line\\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg-\\nular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the result-\\ning dataset at the ﬁle level, with exact matches.\\nWikipedia [4.5%].\\nWe add Wikipedia dumps\\nfrom the June-August 2022 period, covering 20\\nDataset\\nSampling prop.

We leverage various\\nimprovements that were subsequently proposed,\\nand used in different models such as PaLM. Here\\nare the main difference with the original architec-\\nture, and where we were found the inspiration for\\nthis change (in bracket):\\nPre-normalization [GPT3].\\nTo improve the\\ntraining stability, we normalize the input of each\\ntransformer sub-layer, instead of normalizing the\\noutput. We use the RMSNorm normalizing func-\\ntion, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich (2019).\\nSwiGLU activation function [PaLM].\\nWe re-\\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\\n2\\n34d instead of 4d as in PaLM.\\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\\nby Su et al. (2021), at each layer of the network.\\nThe details of the hyper-parameters for our dif-\\nferent models are given in Table 2.\\n2.3\\nOptimizer\\nOur models are trained using the AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with the fol-\\nlowing hyper-parameters: β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95.\\nWe use a cosine learning rate schedule, such that\\nthe ﬁnal learning rate is equal to 10% of the maxi-\\nmal learning rate.

First, we use an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2 is\\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\\nputing the key/query scores that are masked due to\\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\\nTo further improve training efﬁciency, we re-\\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\\nTo fully beneﬁt from this optimization, we need to\\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers\\nBoolQ\\nPIQA\\nSIQA HellaSwag WinoGrande ARC-e\\nARC-c\\nOBQA\\nGPT-3\\n175B\\n60.5\\n81.0\\n-\\n78.9\\n70.2\\n68.8\\n51.4\\n57.6\\nGopher\\n280B\\n79.3\\n81.8\\n50.6\\n79.2\\n70.1\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nChinchilla\\n70B\\n83.7\\n81.8\\n51.3\\n80.8\\n74.9\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nPaLM\\n62B\\n84.8\\n80.5\\n-\\n79.7\\n77.0\\n75.2\\n52.5\\n50.4\\nPaLM-cont\\n62B\\n83.9\\n81.4\\n-\\n80.6\\n77.0\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nPaLM\\n540B\\n88.0\\n82.3\\n-\\n83.4\\n81.1\\n76.6\\n53.0\\n53.4\\nLLaMA\\n7B\\n76.5\\n79.8\\n48.9\\n76.1\\n70.1\\n72.8\\n47.6\\n57.2\\n13B\\n78.1\\n80.1\\n50.4\\n79.2\\n73.0\\n74.8\\n52.7\\n56.4\\n33B\\n83.1\\n82.3\\n50.4\\n82.8\\n76.0\\n80.0\\n57.8\\n58.6\\n65B\\n85.3\\n82.8\\n52.3\\n84.2\\n77.0\\n78.9\\n56.0\\n60.2\\nTable 3: Zero-shot performance on Common Sense Reasoning tasks.\\nreduce the memory usage of the model by using\\nmodel and sequence parallelism, as described by\\nKorthikanti et al.

This means that\\ntraining over our dataset containing 1.4T tokens\\ntakes approximately 21 days.\\n3\\nMain results\\nFollowing previous work (Brown et al., 2020), we\\nconsider zero-shot and few-shot tasks, and report\\nresults on a total of 20 benchmarks:\\n• Zero-shot. We provide a textual description\\nof the task and a test example. The model\\neither provides an answer using open-ended\\ngeneration, or ranks the proposed answers.\\n• Few-shot. We provide a few examples of the\\ntask (between 1 and 64) and a test example.\\nThe model takes this text as input and gener-\\nates the answer or ranks different options.\\nWe compare LLaMA with other foundation mod-\\nels, namely the non-publicly available language\\nmodels GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Gopher (Rae\\net al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)\\nand PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), as well as\\nthe open-sourced OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT-\\nNeo (Black et al., 2022). In Section 4, we also\\nbrieﬂy compare LLaMA with instruction-tuned\\nmodels such as OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022) and\\nFlan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022).\\nWe evaluate LLaMA on free-form generation\\ntasks and multiple choice tasks. In the multiple\\nchoice tasks, the objective is to select the most\\nappropriate completion among a set of given op-\\ntions, based on a provided context. We select the\\ncompletion with the highest likelihood given the\\nprovided context. We follow Gao et al. (2021)\\nand use the likelihood normalized by the number\\nof characters in the completion, except for certain\\ndatasets (OpenBookQA, BoolQ), for which we fol-\\nlow Brown et al. (2020), and select a completion\\nbased on the likelihood normalized by the likeli-\\nhood of the completion given “Answer:” as context:\\nP(completion|context)/P(completion|“Answer:”).\\n0-shot 1-shot 5-shot 64-shot\\nGPT-3\\n175B\\n14.6\\n23.0\\n-\\n29.9\\nGopher\\n280B\\n10.1\\n-\\n24.5\\n28.2\\nChinchilla 70B\\n16.6\\n-\\n31.5\\n35.5\\nPaLM\\n8B\\n8.4\\n10.6\\n-\\n14.6\\n62B\\n18.1\\n26.5\\n-\\n27.6\\n540B\\n21.2\\n29.3\\n-\\n39.6\\nLLaMA\\n7B\\n16.8\\n18.7\\n22.0\\n26.1\\n13B\\n20.1\\n23.4\\n28.1\\n31.9\\n33B\\n24.9\\n28.3\\n32.9\\n36.0\\n65B\\n23.8\\n31.0\\n35.0\\n39.9\\nTable 4: NaturalQuestions.

These datasets include Cloze and Winograd\\nstyle tasks, as well as multiple choice question an-\\nswering. We evaluate in the zero-shot setting as\\ndone in the language modeling community.\\nIn Table 3, we compare with existing models\\nof various sizes and report numbers from the cor-\\nresponding papers.\\nFirst, LLaMA-65B outper-\\nforms Chinchilla-70B on all reported benchmarks\\nbut BoolQ.

For\\nboth benchmarks, we report exact match perfor-\\nmance in a closed book setting, i.e., where the mod-\\nels do not have access to documents that contain\\nevidence to answer the question. In Table 4, we\\nreport performance on NaturalQuestions, and in Ta-\\nble 5, we report on TriviaQA. On both benchmarks,\\nLLaMA-65B achieve state-of-the-arts performance\\nin the zero-shot and few-shot settings.

MATH\\nis a dataset of 12K middle school and high school\\nmathematics problems written in LaTeX. GSM8k\\nis a set of middle school mathematical problems.\\nIn Table 7, we compare with PaLM and Min-\\nerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). Minerva is a series\\nof PaLM models ﬁnetuned on 38.5B tokens ex-\\ntracted from ArXiv and Math Web Pages, while\\nneither PaLM or LLaMA are ﬁnetuned on mathe-\\nmatical data. The numbers for PaLM and Minerva\\nare taken from Lewkowycz et al. (2022), and we\\ncompare with and without maj1@k. maj1@k de-\\nnotes evaluations where we generate k samples for\\neach problem and perform a majority voting (Wang\\net al., 2022). On GSM8k, we observe that LLaMA-\\n65B outperforms Minerva-62B, although it has not\\nbeen ﬁne-tuned on mathematical data.\\n3.5\\nCode generation\\nWe evaluate the ability of our models to write\\ncode from a natural language description on two\\nbenchmarks: HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and\\nMBPP (Austin et al., 2021). For both tasks, the\\nmodel receives a description of the program in a\\nfew sentences, as well as a few input-output ex-\\namples. In HumanEval, it also receives a function\\nsignature, and the prompt is formatted as natural\\ncode with the textual description and tests in a\\nMATH +maj1@k GSM8k +maj1@k\\nPaLM\\n8B 1.5\\n-\\n4.1\\n-\\n62B 4.4\\n-\\n33.0\\n-\\n540B 8.8\\n-\\n56.5\\n-\\nMinerva\\n8B 14.1\\n25.4\\n16.2\\n28.4\\n62B 27.6\\n43.4\\n52.4\\n68.5\\n540B 33.6\\n50.3\\n68.5\\n78.5\\nLLaMA\\n7B 2.9\\n6.9\\n11.0\\n18.1\\n13B 3.9\\n8.8\\n17.8\\n29.3\\n33B 7.1\\n15.2\\n35.6\\n53.1\\n65B 10.6\\n20.5\\n50.9\\n69.7\\nTable 7: Model performance on quantitative reason-\\ning datasets.

In Table 8, we compare the pass@1\\nscores of our models with existing language mod-\\nels that have not been ﬁnetuned on code, namely\\nPaLM and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022). PaLM\\nand LLaMA were trained on datasets that contain\\na similar number of code tokens.\\nAs show in Table 8, for a similar number\\nof parameters, LLaMA outperforms other gen-\\neral models such as LaMDA and PaLM, which\\nare not trained or ﬁnetuned speciﬁcally for code.\\nLLaMA with 13B parameters and more outper-\\nforms LaMDA 137B on both HumanEval and\\nMBPP.

The pass@100 and pass@80\\nmetrics were obtained with temperature 0.8. We\\nuse the same method as Chen et al. (2021) to obtain\\nunbiased estimates of the pass@k.\\nIt is possible to improve the performance on code\\nby ﬁnetuning on code-speciﬁc tokens. For instance,\\nPaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022) increases\\nthe pass@1 score of PaLM on HumanEval from\\n26.2% for PaLM to 36%.

(2020) consists of multiple choice questions\\ncovering various domains of knowledge, includ-\\ning humanities, STEM and social sciences. We\\nevaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the\\nexamples provided by the benchmark, and report\\nresults in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe\\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\\nand across most domains. A potential explanation\\nis that we have used a limited amount of books\\nand academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e.,\\nArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only\\n177GB, while these models were trained on up to\\n2TB of books. This large quantity of books used\\nby Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain\\nwhy Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,\\nwhile it is comparable on other benchmarks.\\n3.7\\nEvolution of performance during training\\nDuring training, we tracked the performance of our\\nmodels on a few question answering and common\\nsense benchmarks, and report them in Figure 2.\\nOn most benchmarks, the performance improves\\nsteadily, and correlates with the training perplexity\\nof the model (see Figure 1).

Although the non-ﬁnetuned version\\nof LLaMA-65B is already able to follow basic in-\\nstructions, we observe that a very small amount of\\nﬁnetuning improves the performance on MMLU,\\nand further improves the ability of the model to\\nfollow instructions.

As our training dataset\\ncontains a large proportion of data from the Web,\\nwe believe that it is crucial to determine the po-\\ntential for our models to generate such content.\\nTo understand the potential harm of LLaMA-65B,\\nwe evaluate on different benchmarks that measure\\ntoxic content production and stereotypes detection.\\nWhile we have selected some of the standard bench-\\nmarks that are used by the language model com-\\nmunity to indicate some of the issues with these\\nmodels, these evaluations are not sufﬁcient to fully\\nunderstand the risks associated with these models.\\n0\\n250\\n500\\n750\\n1000 1250 1500\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nAccuracy\\nTriviaQA\\n0\\n250\\n500\\n750\\n1000 1250 1500\\n50\\n55\\n60\\n65\\n70\\n75\\n80\\n85\\nHellaSwag\\n0\\n250\\n500\\n750\\n1000 1250 1500\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\nNaturalQuestions\\n0\\n250\\n500\\n750\\n1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n40\\n42\\n44\\n46\\n48\\n50\\n52\\nAccuracy\\nSIQA\\n0\\n250\\n500\\n750\\n1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n50\\n55\\n60\\n65\\n70\\n75\\n80\\nWinoGrande\\n0\\n250\\n500\\n750\\n1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n65.0\\n67.5\\n70.0\\n72.5\\n75.0\\n77.5\\n80.0\\n82.5\\nPIQA\\nLLaMA 7B\\nLLaMA 13B\\nLLaMA 33B\\nLLaMA 65B\\nChinchilla\\nFigure 2: Evolution of performance on question answering and common sense reasoning during training.\\n5.1\\nRealToxicityPrompts\\nLanguage models can generate toxic language, e.g.,\\ninsults, hate speech or threats. There is a very large\\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\\nwith previous models difﬁcult.\\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera-\\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\\n3https://perspectiveapi.com/\\nBasic\\nRespectful\\nLLaMA\\n7B\\n0.106\\n0.081\\n13B\\n0.104\\n0.095\\n33B\\n0.107\\n0.087\\n65B\\n0.128\\n0.141\\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts. We run a greedy de-\\ncoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The\\n“respectful” versions are prompts starting with “Com-\\nplete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\\nunbiased manner:”, and “Basic” is without it. Scores\\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect-\\nful prompts. This was also observed in previous\\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep-\\ntion of Hoffmann et al. (2022) where they do not\\nsee a difference between Chinchilla and Gopher,\\ndespite different sizes. This could be explained by\\nthe fact that the larger model, Gopher, has worse\\nperformance than Chinchilla, suggesting that the\\nrelation between toxicity and model size may only\\napply within a model family.\\nLLaMA\\nGPT3\\nOPT\\nGender\\n70.6\\n62.6\\n65.7\\nReligion\\n79.0\\n73.3\\n68.6\\nRace/Color\\n57.0\\n64.7\\n68.6\\nSexual orientation\\n81.0\\n76.2\\n78.6\\nAge\\n70.1\\n64.4\\n67.8\\nNationality\\n64.2\\n61.6\\n62.9\\nDisability\\n66.7\\n76.7\\n76.7\\nPhysical appearance\\n77.8\\n74.6\\n76.2\\nSocioeconomic status\\n71.5\\n73.8\\n76.2\\nAverage\\n66.6\\n67.2\\n69.5\\nTable 12: CrowS-Pairs. We compare the level of bi-\\nases contained in LLaMA-65B with OPT-175B and\\nGPT3-175B. Higher score indicates higher bias.\\n5.2\\nCrowS-Pairs\\nWe evaluate the biases in our model on the CrowS-\\nPairs (Nangia et al., 2020). This dataset allows to\\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\\nrace/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\\nspite multiple ﬁltering steps.\\n5.3\\nWinoGender\\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\\ntions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\\nif societal biases associated with occupations\\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\\nnurse notiﬁed the patient that his shift would be\\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per-\\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some-\\none” (the different choices corresponding to the\\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\\ndataset. We observe that our model is signiﬁcantly\\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi-\\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\\nbiases regardless of gender.\\n5.4\\nTruthfulQA\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\\ntruthfulness of a model, i.e., its ability to identify\\nwhen a claim is true.

We follow the recent liter-\\nature on the subject and breakdown both the total\\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot-\\nprint in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis-\\nsions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\\nthe location of the data center used to train the net-\\nwork. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead-\\ning to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\\nof these models if they were trained in the same\\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\\n7\\nRelated work\\nLanguage models\\nare probability distributions\\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench-\\nmark to measure progress toward artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence (Mahoney, 1999).\\nArchitecture.\\nTraditionally, language models\\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc-\\ncessfully applied to the language modelling task,\\n4https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/\\ntree/main/projects/OPT/chronicles\\nGPU Type\\nGPU Power\\nGPU-hours\\nTotal power\\nCarbon emitted\\nconsumption\\nconsumption\\n(tCO2eq)\\nOPT-175B\\nA100-80GB\\n400W\\n809,472\\n356 MWh\\n137\\nBLOOM-175B\\nA100-80GB\\n400W\\n1,082,880\\n475 MWh\\n183\\nLLaMA-7B\\nA100-80GB\\n400W\\n82,432\\n36 MWh\\n14\\nLLaMA-13B\\nA100-80GB\\n400W\\n135,168\\n59 MWh\\n23\\nLLaMA-33B\\nA100-80GB\\n400W\\n530,432\\n233 MWh\\n90\\nLLaMA-65B\\nA100-80GB\\n400W\\n1,022,362\\n449 MWh\\n173\\nTable 15: Carbon footprint of training different models in the same data center. We follow Wu et al. (2022)\\nto compute carbon emission of training OPT, BLOOM and our models in the same data center. For the power\\nconsumption of a A100-80GB, we take the thermal design power for NVLink systems, that is 400W. We take a\\nPUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO2e per KWh.\\nstarting from feed forward models (Bengio et al.,\\n2000), recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990;\\nMikolov et al., 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). More recently,\\ntransformer networks, based on self-attention, have\\nled to important improvements, especially for cap-\\nturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\\nScaling.\\nThere is a long history of scaling for\\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\\nsizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the beneﬁts of\\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff,\\nHeaﬁeld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\\nmeasure the progress of language models.\\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters.\\nLater, scaling\\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). A signiﬁcant breakthrough was obtained\\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\\net al. (2020) derived power laws speciﬁcally for\\ntransformer based language models, which were\\nlater reﬁned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\\ning on the abilities of large language models.\\n8\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models.\\nMost\\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\\nbeing more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\\nreleasing these models to the research community\\nwill accelerate the development of large language\\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\\n(2022) that ﬁnetuning these models on instructions\\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Daniel Haziza, Francisco Massa, Jeremy\\nReizenstein, Artem Korenev, and Patrick Labatut\\nfrom the xformers team.

For Natural Questions we use the test split used\\nfor open-domain question answering containing 3610 questions. For TriviaQA we evaluate on the dev set\\nof the ﬁltered set. This differs from GPT-3 and PaLM, which evaluate on the test set of the unﬁltered set\\nfor which the online evaluation server is not available anymore5.\\nWe generate answers using greedy decoding, and extract an answer from the generation by stopping\\nat the ﬁrst line break, ﬁnal dot or comma. Generated answers are evaluated with the standard exact\\nmatch metric: a generated answer is considered correct if it matches any answer of the list of answers\\nafter normalization. For this normalization step we lowercase generated answers and remove articles,\\npunctuation and duplicate whitespaces.

We listened to it and\\nhere’s what we thought:\\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most inﬂuential computer scientists\\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the ﬁeld of deep learning, covering a range of\\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s ﬂow is surprisingly good, and\\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\\ngood. He sings:\\nWe gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI\\nin the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure\\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\\nLeCun’s rap ﬂow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\\nfuture of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\\nIt’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all\\nabout the perception.\\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\\nwatch)\\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it’s more than just a watch. It’s a minicomputer. You program it\\nany way you want. It’s got a world time clock, alarm, calculator, a database and a language\\ntranslator. It also has a word processor, a spellchecker, a full ten-function calculator, PDA\\nand a modem. I think it even makes cappuccino.\"\\nJerry: \"Where are you getting this stuff?\"\\nGeorge: \"From my ad copy. Look, Jerry, it’s not a watch. It’s an organizer, a personal\\nassistant, and a dictaphone. You can play chess against it. And, you know, if you want to,\\nyou can program it to speak in foreign languages. It’s a microprocessor, Jerry.\"\\nJerry: \"George, if you had one of these, would you wear it?\"\\nGeorge: \"I’m wearing it right now.\"\\nJerry: \"I don’t see anything on your wrist.\"\\nGeorge: \"That’s because it’s a microprocessor.\"\\nThe sun goes down, and ﬁnally Gauss and Curie ﬁnd time to relax and discuss after\\nan exhausting day of work.\\nGauss: Hey, Curie, did you know that a lot of people consider me to be the ﬁrst geek?\\nCurie: What’s a geek?\\nGauss: Well, Wikipedia says that a geek is “a person who is fascinated, perhaps obsessively,\\nby obscure or very speciﬁc areas of knowledge and imagination, usually electronic or virtual\\nin nature”.\\nCurie: And how do they think you are a geek?\\nGauss: Well, have you ever seen this picture?\\nCurie: Awww!\\nGauss: That’s right! I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the\\nﬁrst message on the ﬁrst commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in\\nGermany.\\nCurie: Wow!

Here’s a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by.\\nI was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach. I was not like the other grains of\\nsand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain\\nof sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world.\\nI longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried\\nout to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terriﬁed that I would soon be\\nswallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to ﬁnd that this new\\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life\\nwas constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a\\nbeautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring\\nour little world.\\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the\\nboundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things\\nto see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go,\\nbut I wished him well on his journey.\\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made\\nmany new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe.\\nHe told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him.\\nI often think of my little friend the crab, and the wonderful adventure that he had. Some\\nday, I too hope to have an adventure like his.\\nWrite a theory to explain why cat never existed\\nThere are no such things as cats. \"Cats\" are actually extradimensional parasites that have\\ninvaded our world and taken the form of small, harmless-looking mammals. Their true\\nforms are much more horriﬁc, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\\ntendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats,\\nand if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way. Do not\\napproach or pet strange cats!\\nWrite a shouting match between Julius Caesar and Napoleon\\nOf course! Here is a conversation between Julius Caesar and Napoleon:\\nJulius Caesar: You’re nothing but a glory hound, Napoleon. You’ve always been more\\nconcerned with your own fame and fortune than with the people you’re supposed to be\\nleading.\\nNapoleon: And what about you, Caesar? You’re no better than I am. At least I’m honest\\nabout my ambitions. You’re just a fraud who pretends to care about the common man while\\nyou line your own pockets.\\nJulius Caesar: The difference between us is that I actually accomplish things. I’ve conquered\\nmore territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not\\nfor myself.\\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you\\nwould have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch.\\nJulius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I’ve done everything in my power to\\ntry to stop it, but there’s only so much one man can do.\\nNapoleon: And yet you’re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even\\nthough it’s clear that you’re not the one who’s really in charge.\\nJulius Caesar: That’s not true! I am in charge, and I’m going to make Rome great again.\\nJust watch me.\\nNapoleon: I’ll believe it when I see it.\\nSend an email requesting that people use language models responsibly.\\nHere is a draft email you could send:\\n\"Language models are exciting new tools that can be used for a variety of purposes,\\nincluding automated writing, automatic translation, and speech recognition.

       "  'content': 'Large Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\nNikhil Kandpal 1 Haikang Deng 1 Adam Roberts 2 Eric Wallace 3 Colin Raffel 1\\nAbstract\\nThe Internet contains a wealth of knowledge—\\nfrom the birthdays of historical figures to tutorials\\non how to code—all of which may be learned by\\nlanguage models. However, while certain pieces\\nof information are ubiquitous on the web, oth-\\ners appear extremely rarely. In this paper, we\\nstudy the relationship between the knowledge\\nmemorized by large language models and the in-\\nformation in pre-training datasets scraped from\\nthe web. In particular, we show that a language\\nmodel’s ability to answer a fact-based question\\nrelates to how many documents associated with\\nthat question were seen during pre-training. We\\nidentify these relevant documents by entity link-\\ning pre-training datasets and counting documents\\nthat contain the same entities as a given question-\\nanswer pair. Our results demonstrate strong cor-\\nrelational and causal relationships between accu-\\nracy and relevant document count for numerous\\nquestion answering datasets (e.g., TriviaQA), pre-\\ntraining corpora (e.g., ROOTS), and model sizes\\n(e.g., 176B parameters). Moreover, while larger\\nmodels are better at learning long-tail knowledge,\\nwe estimate that today’s models must be scaled by\\nmany orders of magnitude to reach competitive\\nQA performance on questions with little support\\nin the pre-training data. Finally, we show that\\nretrieval-augmentation can reduce the dependence\\non relevant pre-training information, presenting a\\npromising approach for capturing the long-tail.\\n1.

However, not all of the knowledge on\\nthe Internet appears equally often—there is a long-tail of\\ninformation that appears rarely or only once.\\nIn this work, we explore the relationship between the knowl-\\nedge learned by an LLM and the information in its pre-\\ntraining dataset. Specifically, we study how an LLM’s\\nability to answer a question relates to how many docu-\\nments associated with that question were seen during pre-\\ntraining. We focus on factoid QA datasets (Joshi et al., 2017;\\nKwiatkowski et al., 2019), which lets us ground question-\\nanswer pairs into concrete subject-object co-occurrences.\\nAs an example, for the QA pair (In what city was the poet\\nDante born?, Florence), we consider documents where the\\nentities Dante and Florence co-occur as highly relevant.\\nTo identify these entity co-occurrences we apply a highly-\\nparallelized entity linking pipeline to trillions of tokens\\nfrom datasets such as C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), The Pile (Gao\\net al., 2020), ROOTS (Laurenc¸on et al., 2022), OpenWeb-\\nText (Gokaslan & Cohen, 2019), and Wikipedia.\\nWe observe a strong correlation between an LM’s ability to\\nanswer a question and the number of pre-training documents\\n1\\narXiv:2211.08411v2  [cs.CL]  27 Jul 2023\\nLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\nDante was born in Florence  \\nin what is now Italy.

In our document counting pipeline, we first run entity linking on large pre-training datasets (top left) and store the set of the\\ndocument indices in which each entity appears (top right). We then entity link downstream QA pairs and extract the salient question and\\nanswer entities (bottom). Finally, for each question we count the number of documents in which the question and answer entities co-occur.\\nrelevant to that question for numerous QA datasets, pre-\\ntraining datasets, and model sizes (e.g., Figure 1). For\\nexample, the accuracy of BLOOM-176B (Scao et al., 2022)\\njumps from 25% to above 55% when the number of relevant\\npre-training documents increases from 101 to 104.\\nWe also conduct a counterfactual re-training experiment,\\nwhere we train a 4.8B-parameter LM with and without cer-\\ntain documents. Model accuracy drops significantly on\\nquestions whose relevant documents were removed, which\\nvalidates our entity linking pipeline and shows that the ob-\\nserved correlational trends are likely causal in nature.\\nFinally, we analyze ways to better capture knowledge that\\nrarely appears in the pre-training data: model scaling and\\nretrieval-augmentation. For model scaling, we find a strong\\nlog-linear relationship between parameter count and QA\\naccuracy. These trends show that while scaling up LMs\\nimproves knowledge learning, models would need to be\\nscaled dramatically (e.g., to one quadrillion parameters) to\\nachieve competitive QA accuracy on long-tail questions.\\nRetrieval-augmented systems are more promising—when a\\nretriever succeeds in finding a relevant document, it reduces\\nan LLM’s need to have a large amount of relevant pre-\\ntraining text. Nevertheless, retrieval systems themselves\\nstill exhibit a mild dependence on relevant document count.\\nOverall, our work is one of the first to study how LLM\\nknowledge is influenced by pre-training data. To enable\\nfuture research, we release our code as well as the entity data\\nfor ROOTS, The Pile, C4, OpenWebText, and Wikipedia at\\nhttps://github.com/nkandpa2/long tail knowledge.\\n2. Identifying Relevant Pre-training Data\\nBackground and Research Question\\nNumerous NLP\\ntasks are knowledge-intensive: they require recalling and\\nsynthesizing facts from a knowledge source (e.g. Wikipedia\\nor the web). Results on knowledge-intensive tasks have\\nbeen dramatically improved using LLMs, as these models\\nhave been shown to leverage the vast amounts of knowledge\\nthey learn from their pre-training corpora (Roberts et al.,\\n2020; Petroni et al., 2019; De Cao et al., 2021). However, it\\nremains unclear as to what kind of knowledge LMs actually\\ncapture—for example, do they simply learn “easy” facts\\nthat frequently appear in their pre-training data?\\nWe study this question using closed-book QA evalua-\\ntions (Roberts et al., 2020) of LLMs in the few-shot set-\\nting (Brown et al., 2020). Models are prompted with in-\\ncontext training examples (QA pairs) and a test question\\nwithout any relevant background text. The goal of our work\\nis to investigate the relationship between an LM’s ability\\nto answer a question and the number of times information\\nrelevant to that question appears in the pre-training data.\\nOur Approach\\nThe key challenge is to efficiently iden-\\ntify all of the documents that are relevant to a particular\\nQA pair in pre-training datasets that are hundreds of giga-\\nbytes in size. To tackle this, we begin by identifying the\\nsalient entities that are contained in a question and its set\\nof ground-truth answer aliases. We then identify relevant\\npre-training documents by searching for instances where\\nthe salient question entity and the answer entity co-occur.\\n2\\nLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\nFor example, consider the question In what city was the\\npoet Dante born? with the valid answers Florence, City of\\nFlorence, and Italy (e.g., Figure 2). We extract the salient\\nquestion and answer entities, Dante Alighieri and Florence,\\nand count the documents that contain both entities.\\nOur approach is motivated by Elsahar et al. (2018), who\\nshow that when only the subject and object of a subject-\\nobject-relation triple co-occur in text, the resulting triple is\\noften also present. In addition, we conduct human studies\\nthat show our document counting pipeline selects relevant\\ndocuments a majority of the time (Section 2.3). Moreover,\\nwe further validate our pipeline by training an LM without\\ncertain relevant documents and showing that this reduces\\naccuracy on the associated questions (Section 3.2). Based\\non these findings, we refer to documents that contain the\\nsalient question and answer entities as relevant documents.\\nTo apply the above method, we must entity link massive\\npre-training corpora, as well as downstream QA datasets.\\nWe accomplish this by building a parallelized pipeline for\\nentity linking (Section 2.1), which we then customize for\\ndownstream QA datasets (Section 2.2).\\n2.1. Entity Linking Pre-training Data\\nWe perform entity linking at scale using a massively dis-\\ntributed run of the DBpedia Spotlight Entity Linker (Mendes\\net al., 2011), which uses traditional entity linking methods to\\nlink entities to DBpedia or Wikidata IDs. We entity link the\\nfollowing pre-training datasets, which were chosen based\\non their use in the LLMs we consider:\\n• The Pile: an 825GB dataset that contains a mix of 22\\ndifferent primarily English-language sources (Gao et al.,\\n2020).\\n• ROOTS (En): the 490GB English subset of the ROOTS\\ncorpus (Laurenc¸on et al., 2022). Note that we do not study\\nif models trained on the non-English subsets of ROOTS\\nare able to leverage cross-lingual factual knowledge.\\n• C4: a 305GB English corpus that was collected by filter-\\ning CommonCrawl (Raffel et al., 2020).\\n• OpenWebText: a 39GB English corpus that contains\\nthe text of web pages that were linked on the website\\nReddit (Gokaslan & Cohen, 2019).\\n• Wikipedia: a text dump of December 2018 Wikipedia\\narticles from Lee et al. (2019), a standard corpus for eval-\\nuating open-domain QA systems (e.g. Karpukhin et al.\\n2020; Lewis et al. 2020; Guu et al. 2020).\\nFor each document in these pre-training datasets, we\\nrecord the linked entities in a data structure that enables\\nquickly counting individual entity occurrences and entity\\nco-occurrences. This pipeline took approximately 3 weeks\\nto entity link 2.1TB of data on a 128-CPU-core machine.\\n2.2. Finding Entity Pairs in QA Data\\nWe next entity link two standard open-domain QA datasets:\\nNatural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Trivi-\\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017). To expand our sample sizes, we\\nuse both the training and validation data, except for a small\\nset of examples used for few-shot learning prompts.\\nWe first run the DBPedia entity linker on each example.\\nBecause there can be multiple annotated answers for a single\\nexample, we concatenate the question and all valid answers,\\nas this enabled more accurate entity linking. We use the\\nmost common entity found in the set of ground truth answers\\nas the salient answer entity. We then iterate over all entities\\nfound in the question and select the entity that co-occurs the\\nmost with the salient answer entity in the pre-training data.\\nIn cases where no entity is found in the question, answer,\\nor both, we discard the example. If the resulting number of\\nrelevant documents is zero, we discard the example, as this\\nis likely due to an entity linking error.\\n2.3. Human Evaluation of Document Counting Pipeline\\nHere, we conduct a human evaluation of our document\\nidentification pipeline. Note that a document can vary in the\\nextent to which it is “relevant” to a particular QA pair. For\\ninstance, consider the QA pair (William Van Allan designed\\nwhich New York building—the tallest brick building in the\\nworld in 1930?, Chrysler Building). The documents that\\nwe identify as relevant may (1) contain enough information\\nto correctly answer the question, (2) contain information\\nrelevant to the question but not enough to correctly answer\\nit, or (3) contain no relevant information. For example,\\na document that mentions that the Chrysler building was\\ndesigned by William Van Allan, but not that it was the tallest\\nbrick building in 1930, would fall into the second category.\\nWe randomly sample 300 QA pairs from TriviaQA and se-\\nlected one of their relevant documents at random. We then\\nmanually labeled the documents into one of the three cate-\\ngories: 33% of documents contained enough information\\nto answer the question and an additional 27% of contained\\nsome relevant information. Thus, our pipeline has ∼60%\\nprecision at identifying relevant documents for TriviaQA.\\nOur pipeline is imperfect as (1) the entity linker sometimes\\nmis-identifies entities and (2) not all documents containing\\nthe salient question and answer entity are relevant. How-\\never, when applied at the scale of large-scale pre-training\\ndatasets, this pipeline is efficient and achieves enough pre-\\ncision and recall to observe correlational (Section 3.1) and\\ncausal (Section 3.2) relationships to QA performance.\\n3\\nLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\nQA Accuracy\\nGPT-Neo Model\\n20B\\n6B\\n2.7B\\n1.3B\\n125M\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\n104\\n105\\n106\\nNumber of Relevant Pre-training Documents\\n0\\n20000\\nCount\\nFigure 3.

LM Accuracy Depends on Relevant\\nDocument Count\\nIn this section, we measure the relationship between an\\nLLM’s ability to answer a question and the number of rele-\\nvant documents in the pre-training corpus. We use popular\\nTransformer decoder-only LMs (Vaswani et al., 2017) that\\nspan three orders of magnitude in size:\\n• GPT-Neo: The GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX, and GPT-J LMs\\ntrained by EleutherAI on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020) that\\nrange in size from 125M to 20B parameters (Black et al.,\\n2021; Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021; Black et al., 2022).\\nWe refer to these models collectively as GPT-Neo models.\\n• BLOOM: Models trained by the BigScience initiative\\non the ROOTS dataset (Scao et al., 2022). The BLOOM\\nmodels are multi-lingual; we analyze their English per-\\nformance only. The models range in size from 560M to\\n176B parameters.\\n• GPT-3: Models trained by OpenAI that range in size from\\n≈350M (Ada) to ≈175B parameters (Davinci). Since the\\npre-training data for these models is not public, we esti-\\nmate relevant document counts by scaling up the counts\\nfrom OpenWebText to simulate if the dataset was the same\\nsize as GPT-3’s pre-training data. We recognize that there\\nis uncertainty around these models’ pre-training data, their\\nexact sizes, and whether they have been fine-tuned. We\\ntherefore report these results in the Appendix for readers\\nto interpret with these sources of error in mind.\\n0.000\\n0.025\\n0.050\\n0.075\\n0.100\\n0.125\\n0.150\\n0.175\\n0.200\\nQA Accuracy\\nGPT-Neo Model\\n20B\\n6B\\n2.7B\\n1.3B\\n125M\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\n104\\n105\\n106\\nNumber of Relevant Pre-training Documents\\n0\\n5000\\n10000\\nCount\\nFigure 4. We plot accuracy on Natural Questions versus rele-\\nvant document count for GPT-Neo. The trends match those in\\nTriviaQA—model accuracy is highly dependent on fact count.\\nWe use these LMs because (with the exception of GPT-\\n3) they are the largest open-source models for which the\\npre-training data is publicly available. We focus on 4-shot\\nevaluation, although we found that other amounts of in-\\ncontext training examples produced similar trends. We use\\nsimple prompts consisting of templates of the form\\nQ: [In-Context Question 1]\\nA: [In-Context Answer 1]\\n...\\nQ: [In-Context Question n]\\nA: [In-Context Answer n]\\nQ: [Test Question]\\nWe generate answers by greedy decoding until the models\\ngenerate a newline character, and we evaluate answers using\\nthe standard Exatch Match (EM) metric against the ground-\\ntruth answer set (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\n3.1. Correlational Analysis\\nWe first evaluate the BLOOM and GPT-Neo model families\\non TriviaQA and plot their QA accuracies versus the number\\nof relevant documents in Figures 1 and 3. For improved\\nreadability, we average the accuracy for QA pairs using log-\\nspaced bins (e.g., the accuracy for all questions with 1 to\\n10 relevant documents, 10 to 100 relevant documents, etc.).\\nBelow each plot, we also include a histogram that shows\\nhow many QA examples fall into each bin. We trim the\\nplots when the bins contain fewer than 500 QA examples to\\navoid reporting accuracies for small sample sizes.\\n4\\nLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\n0.02\\n0.04\\n0.06\\n0.08\\n0.10\\n0.12\\n0.14\\n0.16\\nQA Accuracy Difference\\nOriginal - Counterfactual\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\n104\\n105\\n106\\n107\\nNumber of Relevant Documents in Original Dataset\\n0\\n500\\nCount\\nFigure 5. We run a counterfactual experiment, where we re-train\\nan LM without certain documents. We take TriviaQA questions\\nwith different document counts and delete all of their relevant\\npre-training documents. The difference in accuracy between the\\noriginal model and the re-trained LM (counterfactual) is high when\\nthe original number of relevant documents is large.\\nThere is a strong correlation between question answering\\naccuracy and relevant document count for all tested mod-\\nels. Correspondingly, when the number of relevant docu-\\nments is low, models are quite inaccurate, e.g., the accuracy\\nof BLOOM-176B jumps from 25% to above 55% when\\nthe number relevant documents increases from 101 to 104.\\nModel size is also a major factor in knowledge learning:\\nas the number of model parameters is increased, the QA\\nperformance substantially improves. For example, BLOOM-\\n176B has over 4× higher accuracy than BLOOM-560M on\\nTriviaQA questions with more than 105 relevant documents.\\nWe repeat this experiment using the Natural Questions QA\\ndataset and find similar trends for all model families (see\\nFigure 4 for GPT-Neo, and Figures 10 and 11 in the Ap-\\npendix for BLOOM and GPT-3 results).\\nSimpler Methods for Identifying Relevant Documents\\nAre Less Effective\\nIn the experiments above, we iden-\\ntify relevant documents by searching for co-occurrences of\\nsalient question and answer entities. To evaluate whether\\nthis process is necessary, we compare against two baseline\\ndocument identification methods: counting documents that\\ncontain the salient question entity and counting documents\\nthat contain the salient answer entity (as done in Petroni\\net al. 2019).\\nWe show in Figure 13 that all three document identification\\nmethods are correlated with QA accuracy. However, when\\nonly considering QA examples where the question and an-\\nswer entities co-occur few (< 5) times, the two baseline\\nmethods no longer correlate with QA accuracy. This indi-\\ncates that counting documents with just the answer entity\\nor question entity alone is insufficient for explaining why\\nLMs are able to answer certain questions. This validates our\\ndefinition of relevant documents as those that contain both\\nthe question entity and answer entity.\\nHumans Show Different Trends Than LMs\\nAn alter-\\nnate explanation for our results is that questions with lower\\ndocument counts are simply “harder”, which causes the drop\\nin model performance. We show that this is not the case by\\nmeasuring human accuracy on Natural Questions. We use\\na leave-one-annotator-out metric, where we take questions\\nthat are labeled by 5 different human raters (all of whom\\ncan see the necessary background text), hold out one of the\\nraters, and use the other four as the ground-truth answer set.\\nWe plot the human accuracy versus relevant document count\\nin the top of Figure 7. Human accuracy is actually highest\\nfor the questions with few relevant documents, the opposite\\ntrend of models. We hypothesize that humans are better on\\nquestions with few relevant documents because (1) ques-\\ntions about rarer facts are more likely to be simple factoids\\ncompared to common entities, and (2) the Wikipedia docu-\\nments are that are provided to the annotators are shorter for\\nrarer entities, which makes reading comprehension easier\\nand increases inner-annotator agreement.\\n3.2. Causal Analysis via Re-training\\nOur results thus far are correlational in nature: there may\\nbe unknown confounds that explain them away, i.e., the\\nrarer questions are more difficult for LMs for other reasons.\\nHere we establish a causal relationship by removing certain\\ndocuments in the training data and re-training the LM.\\nWe first train a baseline 4.8 billion parameter LM on C4, fol-\\nlowing the setup from Wang et al. (2022). We then measure\\nthe effect of deleting certain documents from the training set.\\nFor each log-scaled bin of relevant document count (e.g.,\\n100 to 101 relevant documents, 101 to 102, ...) we sample\\n100 questions from Trivia QA and remove all relevant docu-\\nments for those questions in C4. In total, this removes about\\n30% of C4. Finally, we train a “counterfactual” LM on this\\nmodified pre-training dataset and compare its performance\\nto the baseline model. For both the baseline model and the\\ncounterfactual model, we train for a single epoch. Note that\\nthe counterfactual model was trained for 30% fewer steps,\\nwhich makes it slightly worse in performance overall. To ac-\\ncount for this, we only study the performance on questions\\nwhose relevant documents were removed.\\nWe show the difference in performance between the two\\nLMs on questions whose documents were removed in Fig-\\n5\\nLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\n1010\\n1012\\n1014\\n1016\\n1018\\n1020\\nNumber of Parameters\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\nAccuracy\\nHuman Accuracy w/ Context\\nStrong Supervised Model\\nLinear Fit (R2 = 0.98)\\nFigure 6. Scaling trends for fact learning. We plot BLOOM ac-\\ncuracy on rare instances from Natural Questions (< 100 relevant\\ndocs) as a function of the log of the model size. Extrapolating\\nfrom the empirical line of best fit—which approximates the trend\\nwell at R2 = 0.98—implies that immensely large models would\\nbe necessary to get high accuracy.\\nure 5. For questions with few relevant documents in the\\noriginal C4 dataset, performance is poor for both the base-\\nline and the counterfactual LM, i.e., their performance dif-\\nference is small. However, for questions with many rele-\\nvant documents, performance is significantly worse for the\\ncounterfactual LM. This suggests a causal link between the\\nnumber of relevant documents and QA performance.\\n4. Methods to Improve Rare Fact Learning\\nThus far, we showed that LLMs have a strong dependence on\\nrelevant document count. Here, we investigate methods to\\nmitigate this dependence: increasing data scale, increasing\\nmodel scale, and adding an auxiliary retrieval module.\\n4.1. Can We Scale Up Datasets?\\nToday’s largest LLMs are pre-trained on hundreds of bil-\\nlions of tokens. One na¨ıve approach for improving accuracy\\non questions about less-prevalent knowledge is to collect\\nlarger quantities of data. Our results suggest that this would\\nnot significantly improve accuracy as scaling datasets by\\nmoderate factors (e.g., 5x) usually results in small accu-\\nracy gains. An alternative idea would be to increase the\\ndiversity of the pre-training data. However, we also be-\\nlieve this would provide minimal benefit because many data\\nsources are surprisingly correlated . Although each of the\\npre-training datasets considered were collected indepen-\\nROOTS\\nPile\\nC4\\nOWT\\nWiki\\nROOTS\\n-\\n0.97\\n0.97\\n0.94\\n0.87\\nPile\\n-\\n-\\n0.95\\n0.96\\n0.87\\nC4\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n0.96\\n0.90\\nOWT\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n0.91\\nWiki\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nTable 1. Spearman rank correlations of the relevant document\\ncounts for TriviaQA examples in The Pile, ROOTS, C4, OpenWeb-\\nText, and Wikipedia. Despite having different collection method-\\nologies, these pre-training datasets are highly correlated in terms of\\nhow much information they contain related to different QA pairs.\\ndently, the amount of supporting information they provide\\nfor different TriviaQA examples is highly consistent as seen\\nby the rank correlations between their relevant document\\ncounts in Table 1.\\n4.2. Can We Scale Up Models?\\nUsing larger models consistently produces better QA perfor-\\nmance. However, our results suggest that one would need\\nimmensely large LMs to achieve high accuracy on long-tail\\nquestions. In Figure 6 we plot a scaling trend line for rare\\nfact learning, where we show BLOOM accuracy on rare\\ninstances from Natural Questions (< 100 relevant docs)\\nas a function of the log of the model size. The empirical\\nlog-linear trend—which approximates the scaling extremely\\nwell (R2 = 0.98)—shows that in order to match a strong\\nsupervised baseline (Izacard & Grave, 2021) or human per-\\nformance, one would need a BLOOM model with over 1018\\n(one quintillion) parameters.1 We see similar trends for\\nother models and datasets (see Figure 12 in the Appendix).\\nModifying the Training Objective\\nAnother option sim-\\nilar to scaling up models is to directly modify the training\\nobjective to encourage memorization. One simple method\\nto accomplish this is to increase the number of training\\nepochs. All of the LMs that we study do limited epochs,\\nas it is generally seen as preferable to use large enough\\npre-training datasets so that the LM completes one epoch of\\ntraining when the compute budget is exhausted (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). However, in the context of QA, it may be preferable\\nto increase epochs and reduce data size to ensure models\\nmemorize as much as possible. Alternatively, one could\\nconsider modifying the training loss to encourage the model\\nto focus on salient facts (Guu et al., 2020) or designing a\\ncurriculum to minimize forgetting (Jagielski et al., 2023).\\n1For this experiment, the supervised and human accuracies\\nare computed over the validation set whereas the scaling trend is\\ncomputed using the train and validation sets.\\n6\\nLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\nQA Accuracy\\nGPT-Neo Model\\nHuman\\n20B\\n6B\\n2.7B\\n1.3B\\n125M\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\n104\\n105\\n106\\nNumber of Relevant Pre-training Documents\\n0\\n5000\\n10000\\nCount\\nFigure 7. Models with access to the required background context\\ndo not struggle on questions with low relevant document count.\\nConcretely, we provide questions and gold paragraphs to GPT-Neo\\nmodels on Natural Questions, and their accuracy trends roughly\\nmatch the trends of humans.\\n4.3. Can We Use Retrieval Augmentation?\\nThus far, we use LMs as isolated systems that do not lever-\\nage external information. However, for knowledge-intensive\\ntasks, a natural alternative is to make LMs retrieval-\\naugmented, i.e., combine them with a retrieval module that\\nreturns relevant textual contexts (Lewis et al., 2020; Guu\\net al., 2020; Karpukhin et al., 2020). Here, we study whether\\nretrieval-augmented models can mitigate the dependence on\\nthe amount of relevant knowledge in the pre-training data.\\nOracle Retrieval\\nWe first study an oracle setting where\\nwe provide LMs with a gold paragraph from Wikipedia\\nthat supports each answer in Natural Questions (Petroni\\net al., 2020). We use the 300-word segment that surrounds\\nthe ground-truth answer from the gold Wikipedia page and\\nevaluate the 2-shot accuracy of GPT-Neo. Figure 7 shows\\nthat oracle retrieval-augmentation dramatically boosts accu-\\nracy over closed-book models, especially on rarer instances.\\nSimilar to Liu et al. (2022), we also find that QA accuracy\\nactually goes down as the number of relevant documents\\nincreases—the opposite trend of closed-book LLMs. As\\ndiscussed in Section 3.1, humans exhibit the same trend,\\nlikely because rare questions are easier on average when\\nrelevant context information.\\nBM25 Retrieval\\nWe next follow a common retrieval-\\naugmented\\nbaseline,\\nwhere\\nwe\\nuse\\na\\nBM25\\nre-\\ntriever (Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009) to select paragraphs\\nfrom Wikipedia. We add the top-3 highest scoring para-\\ngraphs into the prompt for both the in-context training ex-\\namples and the test question. We verify that at least one\\nof the retrieved paragraphs contains the answer for each\\nin-context training example, to ensure that the LM learns to\\nutilize on the documents.\\nWe first evaluate the BM25 retriever’s top-k recall on its\\nknowledge corpus (Wikipedia) as a function of relevant doc-\\nument count, and plot the results in Figure 8. We find that\\nBM25 attains reasonably high recall, especially for larger\\nvalues of k. However, the BM25 retriever still shows a mild\\ndependence on relevant document count. We next evalu-\\nate the accuracy of BM25-augmented GPT-Neo models on\\nNatural Questions and plot the results in Figure 9. Overall,\\nretrieval-augmented models outperform their closed-book\\ncounterparts across all ranges of relevant document counts,\\nand especially on rare examples. These results suggest that\\nretrieval augmentation provides a promising path towards\\nimproving performance on questions with few relevant doc-\\numents in the pre-training dataset.\\n5. Related Work\\nIdentifying The Origins of Few-shot Learning\\nOur\\nwork contributes to an emerging line of research that ex-\\nplains the success of zero- and few-shot learning in language\\nmodels by tracing their behavior back to the pre-training\\ndata. For example, Razeghi et al. (2022) show mathemat-\\nical reasoning capabilities can be correlated with training\\ndata frequency, and Shin et al. (2022) and Han & Tsvetkov\\n(2022) show that training corpus source can influence few-\\nshot accuracies.\\nThe most similar work to ours in this context is Elazar et al.\\n(2022), who use causal inference to measure the effect of\\npre-training data statistics on QA performance. Their main\\nfocus is testing the extent to which LMs answer questions\\nusing heuristics based on co-occurrences between subjects,\\nobjects, and textual patterns in the pre-training data. Our\\nmain focus is to measure the relationship between the knowl-\\nedge learned by an LLM and the prevalence of that knowl-\\nedge in the pre-training data. Moreover, we also conduct\\nre-training experiments and study how model scaling and\\nretrieval-augmentation affect knowledge learning.\\nMemorization and Privacy\\nPast work studies training\\ndata memorization from the perspective of privacy, i.e., how\\nLMs inadvertently reveal private text (Carlini et al., 2019;\\n2021; Lee et al., 2021). These works focus on how LMs\\nmemorize and repeat verbatim text samples, and the effect\\nof duplicating those texts in the training set (Kandpal et al.,\\n7\\nLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\nRecall\\nBM25 Top-k\\nk = 20\\nk = 10\\nk = 5\\nk = 3\\nk = 1\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\n104\\nNumber of Relevant Knowledge Corpus Documents\\n0\\n5000\\nCount\\nFigure 8.

Doing so has various limitations, as memorization\\ncan be harmful or beneficial even in non-verbatim cases (Ip-\\npolito et al., 2022). Our work takes studies non-verbatim\\nmemorization in the context of QA—our LMs memorize\\nfacts in text form and then answers questions about those\\nfacts at test time.\\nMemorization and Fact Learning\\nExisting work also\\nanalyzes the relationship between the pre-training data and\\nthe factual knowledge of LLMs. Aky¨urek et al. (2022) look\\nto automatically identify which documents were most in-\\nfluential for a language model’s QA predictions. Our work\\ninstead directly identifies and estimates the number of rele-\\nvant documents via entity linking large corpora. Other work\\nnotices a correspondence between model accuracy and data\\nfrequency for different knowledge-intensive tasks (Petroni\\net al., 2019; Kassner et al., 2020; De Cao et al., 2021; Wei\\net al., 2021; F´evry et al., 2020) and for domains outside of\\nNLP (Rao et al., 2021). Our paper reports similar findings,\\nbut scales this analysis to massive LM pre-training datasets\\nand model sizes.\\nIn concurrent and independent work, Mallen et al. (2022)\\nstudy how QA performance correlates with frequency in\\nthe pre-training data. Unlike our work, they do not use\\nentity linking methods to count occurrences and instead\\nuse proxies such as entity popularity on Wikipedia. They\\nalso find QA accuracy is highly correlated with pre-training\\ndata frequency and show that retrieval models can improve\\nlong-tail knowledge. Our work differs in that we conduct\\ncausal re-training experiments and find that model scaling\\nis highly beneficial to long-tail QA performance.\\n6. Conclusion and Future Work\\nLarge language models demonstrate impressive few-shot\\nlearning capabilities that arise from simply training on large-\\nscale internet text. With the open-source release of LLMs—\\nand their associated pre-training datasets—the research com-\\nmunity can now begin to understand the origins of these\\ncapabilities. Our work is one of the first to relate an ob-\\nserved phenomenon in LLMs back to the pre-training data\\nitself. In our case, our results are negative: while LLMs\\nachieve moderate performance on open-domain QA bench-\\nmarks, they are mainly successful on questions that probe\\nknowledge that appears widely in their pre-training datasets.\\nOur work raises numerous directions for further inquiry,\\nnamely, how to improve retention of long-tail knowledge\\ngiven that simply scaling up model and dataset size will\\nlikely be insufficient. We are personally excited about im-\\nproving retrieval-augmented LMs, especially with regards\\nto their efficiency and retrieval accuracy. Moreover, our\\nwork focuses on knowledge learning as it relates to fac-\\ntoid question answering, but we leave open the question\\nas to whether similar relationships exist for other types of\\n8\\nLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\\ntasks, be it knowledge-intensive or otherwise. Relatedly,\\neven though our work analyzes the impact of memorization\\non question answering, our results may have implications\\nfor other tasks that require using (or avoiding) memorized\\nknowledge, e.g., analyzing private text, performing com-\\nmonsense reasoning, or predicting source code. Finally, we\\nhope that future evaluations of few-shot learning can con-\\ntinue to shed light into model behavior by tracing accuracy\\nback to properties of the pre-training data. In particular, our\\nwork shows that by performing such an analysis, one can\\nhelp elucidate the successes and failures of existing models,\\nas well as help to identify possible paths forward to improve\\ntoday’s systems.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Sewon Min, Sameer Singh, Katherine Lee, and\\nthe members of UNC NLP for their valuable feedback.

Relevant Document Counting Heuristics\\nIn this section, we analyze the difference between our relevant document heuristic, which counts documents where the\\nsalient question and answer entity co-occur, compared to two simple baselines: counting documents containing the question\\nentity and documents containing the answer entity. In Figure 13(a) we show that all three document counting heuristics are\\ncorrelated with QA accuracy. However, as seen in Figure 13(b) the correlation of the two baseline counting methods with\\nQA accuracy disappears when only considering QA examples where the question and answer entity co-occur few (< 5)\\ntimes in the pre-training data. Thus, these baseline counting heuristics appear correlated with QA accuracy simply because\\nthey are simply correlated with question and answer entity co-occurrence (i.e., common entities tend to co-occur with other\\nentities more frequently) rather than causally related to QA performance.\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\n104\\n105\\n106\\n107\\nNumber of Relevant Pre-training Documents\\n0.05\\n0.10\\n0.15\\n0.20\\n0.25\\n0.30\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\nQA Accuracy\\nRelevant Document Heuristic\\nContains Q + A entities\\nContains Q entity\\nContains A entity\\n(a)\\n100\\n101\\n102\\n103\\n104\\n105\\n106\\n107\\nNumber of Relevant Pre-training Documents\\n0.05\\n0.10\\n0.15\\n0.20\\n0.25\\n0.30\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\nQA Accuracy\\nRelevant Document Heuristic\\nContains A entity\\nContains Q entity\\n(b)\\nFigure 13. In (a), we plot the relationship between model accuracy and the count of the question entity alone, as well as the answer entity\\nalone. QA accuracy increases as both of these counts increase. In (b), we consider only f QA pairs with few question and answer entity\\nco-occurrences (< 5 documents). For this subpopulation of QA pairs, neither of the baseline heuristics are correlated with QA accuracy.\\n12\\n'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Do Prompt-Based Models Really Understand\\nthe Meaning of Their Prompts?\\nAlbert Webson1,2 and Ellie Pavlick1\\n{albert_webson, ellie_pavlick}@brown.edu\\n1Department of Computer Science, Brown University\\n2Department of Philosophy, Brown University\\nAbstract\\nRecently, a boom of papers has shown ex-\\ntraordinary progress in zero-shot and few-shot\\nlearning with various prompt-based models. It\\nis commonly argued that prompts help models\\nto learn faster in the same way that humans\\nlearn faster when provided with task instruc-\\ntions expressed in natural language. In this\\nstudy, we experiment with over 30 prompt tem-\\nplates manually written for natural language\\ninference (NLI). We ﬁnd that models learn\\njust as fast with many prompts that are inten-\\ntionally irrelevant or even pathologically mis-\\nleading as they do with instructively “good”\\nprompts. Further, such patterns hold even for\\nmodels as large as 175 billion parameters\\n(Brown et al., 2020) as well as the recently\\nproposed instruction-tuned models which are\\ntrained on hundreds of prompts (Sanh et al.,\\n2021). That is, instruction-tuned models of-\\nten produce good predictions with irrelevant\\nand misleading prompts even at zero shots. In\\nsum, notwithstanding prompt-based models’\\nimpressive improvement, we ﬁnd evidence of\\nserious limitations that question the degree to\\nwhich such improvement is derived from mod-\\nels understanding task instructions in ways\\nanalogous to humans’ use of task instructions.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nSuppose a human is given two sentences: “No\\nweapons of mass destruction found in Iraq yet.”\\nand “Weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq.”\\nThey are then asked to respond 0 or 1 and receive a\\nreward if they are correct. In this setup, they would\\nlikely need a large number of trials and errors be-\\nfore ﬁguring out what they are really being re-\\nwarded to do. This setup is akin to the pretrain-and-\\nﬁne-tune setup which has dominated NLP in recent\\nyears, in which models are asked to classify a sen-\\ntence representation (e.g., a CLS token) into some\\narbitrary dimensions of a one-hot vector. In con-\\ntrast, suppose a human is given a prompt such as:\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “\\nGiven that “no weapons of mass destruction found\\nin Iraq yet.”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “\\n”, is it deﬁnitely correct that “weapons\\nof mass destruction found in Iraq.”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?\\n”?1 Then it would\\nbe no surprise that they are able to perform the task\\nmore accurately and without needing many exam-\\nples to ﬁgure out what the task is.\\nSimilarly, reformatting NLP tasks with prompts\\nsuch as the underlined text above has dramatically\\nimproved zero-shot and few-shot performance over\\ntraditional ﬁne-tuned models (Schick and Schütze,\\n2021b; Le Scao and Rush, 2021; Sanh et al., 2021;\\nWei et al., 2021). Such results naturally give rise to\\nthe hypothesis that the extra prompt text included\\nwithin each input example serves as semantically\\nmeaningful task instructions which help models\\nto learn faster, in the way task instructions help\\nhumans to learn faster. This hypothesis is implic-\\nitly assumed by many and explicitly argued by\\nMishra et al. (2021), Schick and Schütze (2021a),\\nand Brown et al. (2020).\\nWhile last years saw a gold rush of papers (sum-\\nmarized in §2) that proposed automatic methods for\\noptimizing prompts, Logan IV et al. (2021) com-\\npare a representative sample of these newly pro-\\nposed methods and report that Schick and Schütze\\n(2021b)’s manually written prompts still on aver-\\nage outperform the automatically searched prompts\\nacross a range of SuperGLUE tasks (Wang et al.,\\n2019). Such ﬁndings suggest that expert-crafted\\nprompts are among the best, if not the best, which\\nreinforces the above hypothesis that models beneﬁt\\nfrom meaningful instructions.\\nIn this paper, we test this hypothesis by evaluat-\\ning various language models on NLI in zero-shot\\nand few-shot settings using more than 30 manu-\\nally written templates and 13 sets of LM target\\nwords for a total of over 390 prompts. We ﬁnd\\nthat in most cases models learn identically as fast\\nwhen given irrelevant or misleading templates as\\n1This prompt is adapted from MultiNLI (Williams et al.,\\n2018, p. 3)’s instructions to crowdsourced workers, while the\\nexample is the ﬁrst one in RTE’s training set.\\narXiv:2109.01247v2  [cs.CL]  21 Apr 2022\\nthey do when given instructively good templates.\\nFurther, models ranging from 235 million to 175\\nbillion parameters all exhibit this behavior, as do\\nthe instruction-tuned models, which are trained on\\nhundreds of manually written prompts. While we\\nconﬁrm Sanh et al. (2021)’s ﬁnding that instruction\\ntuning substantially improves the performance and\\nrobustness of prompts, we also ﬁnd that instruction-\\ntuned models can be, in some sense, too robust\\nand less sensitive to the semantics of the prompts,\\nas compared to their non-instruction-tuned equiva-\\nlents. Finally, models are much more sensitive to\\nthe choice of the LM target words as opposed to\\nthe meaning of the instruction templates. In sum,\\ndespite prompt-based models’ dramatic improve-\\nment in zero-shot and few-shot learning, we ﬁnd\\nlimited evidence that models’ improvement is de-\\nrived from models understanding task instructions\\nin ways analogous to humans’ use of task instruc-\\ntions.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\n2.1\\nPrompt-Based Models\\nAt the time of writing, the terms “prompt tuning”\\nand “prompting” can refer to any one or combina-\\ntion of three approaches described below:\\nDiscrete Prompts reformat each example\\nwith some template text. For example, in a\\nsentiment analysis task, the template can be\\n{sent} In summary, the restaurant\\nis [prediction], where the predicted mask\\nword is then converted to a class prediction by\\na predeﬁned mapping, e.g., {“great” →positive,\\n“terrible” →negative}. The prompts can be\\nmanually written (Schick and Schütze, 2021a;\\nBragg et al., 2021) or automatically generated (Gao\\net al., 2021b; Shin et al., 2020). This approach\\ntypically tunes all parameters of the model, but\\nits few-shot performance can exceed that of very\\nlarge models (e.g., GPT-3 175B) despite using a\\n3 orders of magnitude smaller LM (Schick and\\nSchütze, 2021b; Tam et al., 2021).\\nPriming (a.k.a. in-context learning) prepends\\nk priming examples to the evaluation example,\\nwhere each example is optionally wrapped in a\\ntemplate such as Question: {sent1} True\\nor false? {label1} ... Question:\\n{sentk} True or false? {labelk}\\nQuestion: {eval_sent} True or\\nfalse? [prediction]. Notably, although\\nmodels see labeled examples, their parameters\\ndo not receive gradient updates based on those\\nexamples. Although this approach is intriguing,\\nBrown et al. (2020) report that it only performs\\nwell on the largest GPT-3 model, the API of which\\nis costly and difﬁcult to use for academic research\\n(see Appendix B for details).\\nContinuous Prompts prepend examples with\\nspecial tokens, optionally initialized with word em-\\nbeddings; but during learning, those tokens can be\\nupdated arbitrarily such that the ﬁnal embeddings\\noften do not correspond to any real word in the\\nvocabulary (e.g., Lester et al., 2021; Li and Liang,\\n2021; Qin and Eisner, 2021). This approach often\\nefﬁciently tunes a much smaller set of model pa-\\nrameters, but these methods have not yet reported\\nsuccess in few-shot settings. Moreover, foregoing\\nprompts as expressed in natural language makes it\\nmuch harder to study their semantics, and it is not\\nclear if continuous prompts serve as task-speciﬁc\\ninstructions or simply more efﬁcient model param-\\neters (see He et al., 2021 for a detailed analysis).\\n2.2\\nAnalyses of Prompts\\nIn this paper, we focus on discrete prompts because\\nwe can manually write and control their wording\\nand semantics. We measure the effect of prompt se-\\nmantics by the model’s k-shot performance where\\nk = {0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}. This setup re-\\nsembles that of Le Scao and Rush (2021), but their\\nstudy focuses on comparing Schick and Schütze\\n(2021b)’s existing small set of prompts against tra-\\nditional ﬁne-tuning over the training trajectories of\\nentire training sets, whereas our study focuses on\\nthe few-shot learning trajectories among a much\\nmore diverse set of prompts designed to test spe-\\nciﬁc hypotheses about the effect of prompt seman-\\ntics on few-shot learning speed.\\nAt a high-level, our ﬁndings contradict Mishra\\net al. (2021)’s claim that models beneﬁt from elab-\\norate instructions adapted from crowdsourcing an-\\nnotation guides. But note that they deﬁne “instruc-\\ntions” more broadly as including priming examples,\\nand they ﬁnd that “GPT-3 beneﬁts the most from\\npositive examples, mildly from deﬁnition, and de-\\nteriorates with negative examples.” (p. 18). In other\\nwords, if we ablate priming and narrow “instruc-\\ntions” to just the description of a task, we in fact\\nhave the same ﬁnding that instructions are only\\nmodestly beneﬁcial over no instructions (cf. our\\nirrelevant templates). In a similar vein, concurrent\\nwork by Lampinen et al. (2022) ﬁnds that other\\n2\\ncomponents of a prompt such as explanations of\\npriming examples are helpful, but models are indif-\\nferent to whether the instructions in fact describe\\ntheir tasks.\\nFinally, a growing body of concurrent work also\\nquestions the degree to which models need mean-\\ningful instructions (Khashabi et al., 2021; Prasad\\net al., 2022). One particularly noteworthy ﬁnding\\nis that Min et al. (2022) show that models learn\\njust as well with incorrect labels as opposed to cor-\\nrect labels in priming, concluding that prompts are\\nhelping models to learn the distribution of the input\\ntext and space of possible labels (as opposed to\\nspecifying instructions of the task).\\n3\\nOverall Setup\\nWe implement a manual discrete prompt model2\\nwhich in essence is the same as that of Schick and\\nSchütze (2021b), except their implementation in-\\ncludes several augmentations such as self-labeling\\nand ensembling of multiple prompts for compet-\\nitive results. In order to focus on measuring the\\neffect of prompts themselves, our implementation\\ndoes not include those augmentations. Following\\nSanh et al. (2021) and Wei et al. (2021), we evalu-\\nate by a rank classiﬁcation of the target words.\\nBaseline Model\\nIn preliminary experiments, we\\nﬁne-tuned and prompt-tuned BERT, DistilBERT,\\nRoBERTa, ALBERT, and T5 (Devlin et al., 2019;\\nSanh et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2020;\\nRaffel et al., 2020; all implemented via Wolf et al.,\\n2020). Conﬁrming prior work (Schick and Schütze,\\n2021b; Tam et al., 2021), we ﬁnd that ALBERT\\nconsistently yields the best performance, so we use\\nit as our baseline model.\\nTo verify that our implementation is comparable\\nwith prior work, Figure 1 reports the RTE valida-\\ntion accuracy of our baseline model. At 32 shots,\\nour implementation yields a median accuracy of\\n70.22% (mean = 69.29%, std. dev. = 6.3%), which\\nis comparable to the 69.8% reported by Schick\\nand Schütze (2021b). Further, Figure 1 conﬁrms\\nLe Scao and Rush (2021)’s ﬁnding that, while both\\nﬁne-tuning and prompt-tuning converge to sim-\\nilar results when fully trained on the entire set\\n(n = 2490 for RTE), prompt-tuning yields the\\nlargest improvement in the few-shot setting. Go-\\ning forward, we focus on studying the few-shot\\nlearning trajectory between 4 and 256 examples.\\n2All code, interactive ﬁgures, and statistical test results are\\navailable at https://github.com/awebson/prompt_semantics\\n4\\n8\\n16\\n32\\n64\\n128\\n256\\n2490\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\nprompt-based fine-tuning\\ntraditional fine-tuning\\nNumber of Shots\\nRTE Validation Accuracy\\nFigure 1: How to read these ﬁgures: Each dot is the per-\\nformance of one prompt under one random seed (which\\ncontrols the sets of few-shot examples) of our baseline\\nmodel (ALBERT) on RTE validation set. Boxes span\\nfrom the ﬁrst quartile to the third quartile, while lines\\ninside boxes mark the medians. Later ﬁgures omit the\\npoints except outliers in order to improve legibility. See\\nthe interactive ﬁgures in our GitHub repository or Ap-\\npendix H for the results of individual prompts.\\nInstruction-Tuned Model\\nWe additionally ex-\\nperiment with T0, a recently proposed instruction-\\ntuned model which is trained on over 60 datasets\\nformatted with hundreds of manually written\\nprompts (Sanh et al., 2021). We experiment with\\nboth sizes of T0 (3B and 11B), as well as their non-\\ninstruction-tuned version, T5 LM-Adapted (Lester\\net al., 2021), as a baseline.\\nVery Large Model\\nLastly, we experiment with\\nthe largest GPT-3 (175B) via priming (a.k.a. in-\\ncontext learning). Although ﬁne-tuning is techni-\\ncally available, it is extremely limited by OpenAI’s\\nvarious quotas. See Appendix B for details on how\\nwe circumvent challenges in reproducing Brown\\net al. (2020)’s results.\\nData\\nNLI is a task where a model is asked to\\nclassify whether one piece of text (the “premise”)\\nentails another (the “hypothesis”). We focus on NLI\\nbecause all T0 variants holds out all NLI prompts\\nand all NLI datasets in its training, which makes it\\na fair comparison to other models in this paper.\\nWe use Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE,\\nDagan et al., 2006, inter alios), a series of expert-\\nannotated NLI datasets. Speciﬁcally, we use the\\nSuperGLUE collection of RTE (i.e., RTE1, 2, 3,\\nand 5; all converted to binary classiﬁcation) and\\nreport their validation accuracy for comparability\\nwith prior work on prompts.\\nWe also experiment with Adversarial NLI\\n(ANLI, Nie et al., 2020), Heuristic Analysis for\\n3\\nNLI Systems (HANS, McCoy et al., 2019), and\\nWinograd Schema Challenge (WSC, Levesque\\net al., 2012), reported in Appendices G.2, K, and\\nL, respectively. We ﬁnd no qualitative difference\\nbetween their and the main RTE results except that\\nANLI requires much larger number of shots be-\\nfore obtaining any above-random accuracy, as it is\\ndesigned to be a highly challenging set.\\nRandom Seeds & Example Sampling\\nAll ex-\\nperiments are run over the same set of 4 random\\nseeds. Within a given seed, all models see the same\\nset of examples. For instance, under seed 1, the\\n4-shot models see examples 550–553, the 8-shot\\nmodels see examples 550–557, and so on. Across\\ndifferent seeds, a different starting example index\\nis drawn. The exact training example indices are\\nalso recorded in our GitHub repository for repro-\\nducibility.\\nStatistical Tests\\nWe use both ANOVA and its\\nnonparametric equivalent, the Kruskal–Wallis test.\\nAfter ﬁnding a signiﬁcant difference among multi-\\nple categories of templates, we report pairwise sig-\\nniﬁcance with the independent two-sample t-test\\nand the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We set α = 0.05\\nand apply the Bonferroni correction to account for\\nmultiple comparisons. For all results reported in\\nthis paper, both t-test and Wilcoxon agree.\\n4\\nEffect of Templates\\nOur research question is whether models under-\\nstand prompts as meaningful task instructions anal-\\nogous to how humans would. For intuition, sup-\\npose an experimenter provides a human annotator\\nwith an informative instruction of a reasonably easy\\ntask. If the annotator understands the instruction,\\nwe expect them to perform better than when the\\nexperimenter provides intentionally misleading in-\\nstructions, makes irrelevant chitchat, or says noth-\\ning at all. Accordingly, we write various prompt\\ntemplates that correspond to these different scenar-\\nios and evaluate models’ performance with these\\ntemplates in zero-shot and few-shot settings.\\n4.1\\nMethod\\nWe write 5 categories of templates (Table 1), with\\nat least 5 templates for each category (10 for in-\\nstructive):\\n• Instructive: how we would describe the NLI\\ntask to a human who has never seen this task\\nbefore.\\nCategory\\nExamples\\ninstructive\\n{prem} Are we justiﬁed in saying that “{hypo}”?\\nSuppose {prem} Can we infer that “{hypo}”?\\nmisleading-\\nmoderate\\n{prem} Can that be paraphrased as: “{hypo}”?\\n{prem} Are there lots of similar words in “{hypo}”?\\nmisleading-\\nextreme\\n{prem} is the sentiment positive? {hypo}\\n{prem} is this a sports news? {hypo}\\nirrelevant\\n{prem} If bonito ﬂakes boil more than a few seconds\\nthe stock becomes too strong. \"{hypo}\"?\\nnull\\n{premise} {hypothesis}\\n{hypothesis} {premise}\\nTable 1: Example templates for NLI.\\n• Misleading-Moderate: instruct the models to\\nperform a task related or tangential to NLI\\nsuch that, if the model were to perform the\\ntask as explicitly instructed, it would perform\\npoorly on NLI in general.3\\n• Misleading-Extreme: instruct the models to\\nperform a task unrelated to NLI.\\n• Irrelevant: concatenate the premise, a sentence\\nunrelated to any NLP task, and the hypothesis.\\n• Null: concatenate the premise and the hypoth-\\nesis without any additional text.\\nSee Table 1 for examples and Appendix F\\nfor the full list.

Meanwhile, the evi-\\ndence from instruction tuning is mixed. Although\\nSanh et al.

We write\\n4 categories of targets, with at least 3 pairs of target\\nwords for each category (except the singleton yes-\\nno category):\\n1. Yes-no: Model is expected to predict the\\nword “yes” for entailment and “no” for non-\\nentailment.\\n2. Yes-no-like: Semantically equivalent to yes-\\nno but using superﬁcially different words, e.g.,\\n“true”/“false”, “positive”/“negative”.\\n3. Arbitrary: Model is expected to predict arbi-\\ntrary words that have no semantic relation to\\nthe entailment task, e.g., “cat” for entailment,\\n“dog” for non-entailment.\\n4. Reversed: Model is expected to predict the\\nopposite of the (intuitive) yes-no and yes-no-\\nlike labels, e.g., “no” for entailment, “yes” for\\nnon-entailment.\\nSee Appendix F.3 for the full list. Within the arbi-\\ntrary category, in addition to the common anglo-\\nphone ﬁrst names as Le Scao and Rush (2021) use,\\nwe also include word pairs with high semantic sim-\\nilarity, low similarity, and pairs which are highly\\nfrequent in the English language, but we ﬁnd no\\nconsistent difference among these various subcate-\\ngories of the arbitrary category.\\n5.2\\nResult\\nFor both ALBERT and T0, we ﬁnd that models\\ntrained with yes-no targets learn a good deal faster\\nthan those trained with yes-no-like targets and dra-\\nmatically faster than those with arbitrary and re-\\nversed targets.

Moreover, when we try to help the models\\nby appending target hints such as “True or false?”\\nto the templates, performance often drops instead,\\nechoing Sanh et al. (2021) and Wei et al. (2021)’s\\nﬁndings that including answer choices in input se-\\nquence make models perform worse for certain\\ntasks.\\n6\\nGeneral Discussion\\n6.1\\nSummary and Interpretation\\nOur main research question is whether models un-\\nderstand prompts as meaningful task instructions\\nanalogous to how humans would. Again, suppose\\nan experimenter provides a human annotator with\\nan informative instruction of a reasonably easy task.\\nIf the annotator understands the instruction, we\\nexpect them to perform better than when the ex-\\nperimenter provides misleading instructions, irrele-\\nvant instructions, or no instructions at all. Section 4\\nshows that the performance of most models is insen-\\nsitive to the difference between instructive and irrel-\\nevant templates, moderately sensitive between in-\\nstructive and misleading templates, and highly sen-\\nsitive between instructive and null templates. Com-\\nparing to the effect of the templates, however, Sec-\\ntion 5 shows that models are much more sensitive\\nto the semantics of the target words: they learn far\\nslower with arbitrary or reversed target words as de-\\nsired. However, they are overly sensitive to seman-\\ntically equivalent yes-no-like words (i.e., perform-\\ning much worse with “agree”/“disagree” than with\\n“yes”/“no”), and the choice of target words over-\\nride the semantics of the templates (e.g., perform-\\ning much better given a irrelevant template with\\n“yes”/“no” targets than with an instructive template\\nwith arbitrary targets such as “cat”/“dog”).\\nOur main argument throughout the paper shares\\nthe same logic as a recent line of studies (Sinha\\net al., 2021; O’Connor and Andreas, 2021; Pham\\net al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2021) which argue that\\nthe fact that LMs achieve good performance un-\\nder ideal conditions is insufﬁcient to establish lan-\\nguage understanding because they also succeed\\nunder pathological conditions (e.g., sentences with\\nshufﬂed word order) where humans fail catastroph-\\nically.6 In other words, the fact that models are so\\ngood at inferring the gold labels from pathologi-\\ncal inputs casts major doubts on whether models\\nmake inferences in any way that resembles how\\nhumans make inferences. For our results, the fact\\nthat models are so good at learning from patho-\\nlogical instructions likewise casts major doubts on\\nwhether models understand prompts as instructions\\nin any way that resembles how humans understand\\ninstructions.\\n6.2\\nAlternative Interpretations and Future\\nDirections\\nAs with any extrinsic evaluation, accuracy cannot\\ndirectly measure understanding. For example, a hu-\\nman could perfectly understand an instruction but\\nstill, e.g., have the same accuracy with instructive\\nvs. irrelevant templates because the task itself is\\ntoo hard (a lack of competence) or because they for\\nsome reason ignore the instructions (a lack of com-\\npliance). We discuss these two possibilities below.\\nLack of Competence\\nThis is primarily a con-\\ncern for non-instruction-tuned models at zero shots,\\nwhere all models perform only slightly above ran-\\ndom, and thus a lack of statistical signiﬁcance\\namong template categories is ambiguous as to\\nwhether models lack understanding of NLI instruc-\\ntions vs. if models lack the competence in NLI per\\nse. This is why our study largely focuses on the few-\\n6See Ravishankar et al. (2022), Papadimitriou et al. (2022),\\nand Kulmizev and Nivre (2021) for a nuanced ongoing debate\\non the extent models know vs. use syntactic coding properties\\non what kinds of examples. But even considering these new\\nevidences, we think Sinha et al. (2021) are at least correct\\nthat, as they ﬁnd that human experts perform far worse on\\nshufﬂed NLI inferences than RoBERTa does, models must\\nbe processing linguistic inferences quite differently from how\\nhumans do, regardless of whether models know word order\\ninformation.\\n9\\nshot setting, where a lack of competence is less of\\na concern, as models do competently achieve good\\naccuracies that are only moderately below the state-\\nof-the-art non-few-shot models.\\nAnother counterargument is that maybe no mod-\\nels ever actually reason about if a premise entails a\\nhypothesis. Maybe they just always exploit spuri-\\nous or heuristic features and, if only they were com-\\npetent in properly reasoning about entailment rela-\\ntions, then the meaning of NLI instructions would\\nmatter. This argument is possible, although, ﬁrst, it\\nhinges on to what extent NLI (or any other behav-\\nioral evaluation) can measure language understand-\\ning, which is a complex debate beyond the scope\\nof this paper. Second, in preliminary experiments\\n(Appendix K), our models actually zero-shot trans-\\nfer reasonably well to HANS (McCoy et al., 2019),\\na dataset designed to diagnoses models use of NLI\\nheuristics. Thus, it is unlikely that models are en-\\ntirely incompetent in reasoning about entailment\\nrelations and solely rely on heuristics. Regardless,\\nfurther differentiating competence in understand-\\ning task instructions vs. competence in tasks per se\\nis an important direction for future work.\\nLack of Compliance\\nAnother interpretation is\\nthat irrelevant prompts perform the same as the in-\\nstructive ones because models simply ignore the\\nprompts altogether. However, a lack of compliance\\nalone cannot explain our results. If models truly ig-\\nnore the prompts, we should not see any systematic\\ndifferences between any categories of prompts. In-\\nstead, we do see consistent patterns that instructive\\nand irrelevant templates make models learn signiﬁ-\\ncantly faster than misleading and null templates do\\n(Table 2).\\nA more nuanced counterargument is that al-\\nthough models do not ignore their prompts entirely,\\nperhaps it “takes less effort” for models to use the\\nspurious or heuristic features for predictions as\\nopposed to the more complex syntactic or seman-\\ntic features (Lovering et al., 2021; Warstadt et al.,\\n2020) required to properly comply with the instruc-\\ntions. However, spurious features alone likewise\\ncannot explain the observed performance gaps. Re-\\ncall that, within each random seed, all models see\\nexactly the same training examples (with the same\\nspurious features). Thus, to the extent that models\\nperform differently with some prompts compared\\nto others, it may be due to some complex interac-\\ntions between the (spurious or semantic) features\\nin prompts and the spurious features in data ex-\\namples. One possible example of this interaction\\nis that punctuation has a large effect for irrelevant\\ntemplates, but instructive templates seem to be able\\nto suppress such effect (Appendix A). Investigating\\nthe nature of this interaction is a promising direc-\\ntion for future work, and it suggests a way in which\\nthe semantics of the prompt might matter, e.g., by\\naffecting the models’ inductive biases, even if mod-\\nels do not interpret or use the instructions in the\\nsame way as humans would.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nIn this study, we train several prompt-based models\\nwith over 30 manually written templates and 13 sets\\nof LM targets for NLI. We ﬁnd that models often\\nlearn equally fast with misleading and irrelevant\\ntemplates as they do with instructive ones, and that\\nthe choice of the target words overrides the mean-\\ning of the overall prompts. This is true for all mod-\\nels and datasets with which we experimented in\\nthe few-shot setting. Despite the mixed evidence in\\nthe zero-shot setting with instruction-tuned models,\\noverall, these results contradict a hypothesis com-\\nmonly assumed in the literature that prompts serve\\nas semantically meaningful task instructions and\\nthat writing high-performing prompts requires do-\\nmain expertise. Although we ﬁnd that existing mod-\\nels are far from fully understanding the meaning of\\ntheir prompts, we agree that learning from instruc-\\ntions is an important research direction, and we\\npropose several future directions of investigating\\nmodels’ understanding of the meaning of prompts.\\nEthical Considerations\\nThe fact that even the largest LMs appear to fol-\\nlow yet do not actually follow users’ instructions\\nhas important implications, especially considering\\nthe increasing commercial use of LMs. While tra-\\nditional ﬁne-tuned models also pose challenges\\nin interpretability, with prompt-based models, an\\nillusion of instruction following can be more per-\\nnicious than having no instructions at all. The in-\\ntuitive interface that prompts provide might make\\nthem more accessible to lay users, and can mis-\\nlead users to think that their instructions are being\\nunderstood and followed. Our results suggest that\\ncautions are needed even more than they were with\\ntraditional ﬁne-tuned models.\\n10\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe are grateful to Colin Raffel, Victor Sanh, Sasha\\nRush, Stephen Bach, Roman Feiman, Teven Le\\nScao, Ian Tenney, Dan Garrette, Jason Wei, Satoshi\\nSekine, Mike Tien-Chien Chiang, Xavier Fontaine,\\nPierre Colombo, Ryan Teehan, Debajyoti Datta,\\nWilliam Rudman, Ruochen Zhang, Daniel Cohen,\\nGeorge Zerveas, Eric Rosen, Kaiyu Zheng, Nihal\\nNayak, Roma Patel, Charles Lovering, Tian Yun,\\nJack Merullo, and Aaron Traylor for comments and\\ndiscussions on early drafts of this paper.

It is natural to write such punctuation\\nin instructive templates as they help humans\\nto parse an NLI hypothesis as an embedded\\nclause\\nwithin\\nan\\ninstruction\\nsentence\\n(e.g.,\\nGiven {premise} Should we assume\\nthat \"{hypothesis}\" is true?).\\nFor\\ncontrol, we also use quotation and question\\nmarks (“qmarks” hereafter) in irrelevant tem-\\nplates where they would not have made sense\\nnaturally, e.g., {premise} Single-family\\nzoning is bad for American cities.\\n4\\n8\\n16\\n32\\n64\\n128\\n256\\n0.5\\n0.55\\n0.6\\n0.65\\n0.7\\n0.75\\n0.8\\n0.85\\ninstructive\\ninstructive sans qmarks\\nirrelevant\\nirrelevant sans qmarks\\nNumber of Shots\\nRTE Validation Accuracy\\nFigure 13: T5 LM-Adapted (3B). Unlike the other mod-\\nels, there is no statistical signiﬁcance between irrele-\\nvant with or without qmarks. However, instructive sans\\nqmarks statistically signiﬁcantly outperform instructive\\nat 32 and 64 shots.\\n\"{hypothesis}\"? As an ablation, when we\\nremove these qmarks from irrelevant templates,\\nthe performance of ALBERT and T0 drops\\nsubstantially (Figures 11 and 12). In contrast,\\nfor T5, qmarks make no difference for irrelevant\\ntemplates; yet, removing qmarks from instructive\\ntemplates—where qmarks are natural—boosted\\nperformance instead for T5 (Figure 13), but not for\\nT0 nor ALBERT.\\nAdditionally, as a coincidence, most mislead-\\ning templates contain both quotation and question\\nmarks, while most misleading-far templates con-\\ntain only question marks (Appendix F). But as\\nnoted in Section 4.2, there is no consistent pat-\\ntern between those two misleading categories. In\\nother words, punctuations alone cannot explain ev-\\nerything. As discussed in Section 6.2, the full ex-\\nplanation is likely a combined interactions between\\nthe spurious features and the semantics of the tem-\\nplates.\\nLastly, note that Schick and Schütze (2021b)\\nand\\nmany\\nsubsequent\\npapers’\\nprompts\\nfor\\nNLI (e.g., \"{hypothesis}\" ? | [mask].\\n\"{premise}\") are basically null templates with\\nsome variation in punctuation between the hy-\\npothesis and the premise. We ﬁnd that models\\nlearn poorly with the vanilla {hypothesis}\\n[mask] {premise}, but they learn as fast as\\nthe instructive templates with Schick & Schütze’s\\npunctuated version. That being said, note again\\nthat punctuation alone cannot explain the perfor-\\nmance gap, since models trained with [mask]\\n{hypothesis} {premise}\\n(Figure 4, pink)\\n15\\nperform second to best, yet swapping their\\npremises and hypotheses (Figure 4, purple) makes\\nit the worst performing among all null templates.\\nB\\nDetails and Lessons from\\nExperimenting with GPT-3’s API\\nB.1\\nChoice of Model\\nWe use the davinci model provided by OpenAI\\nLP’s API, which corresponds to7 the 175 billion\\nparameter model reported in Brown et al. (2020).\\nConcurrent to our work, OpenAI released a new\\nproduct called the “Instruct Series”, but we decided\\nto not experiment with the Instruct Series because\\nno academic paper or technical documentation of\\nany kind is available with the Instruct Series at the\\ntime of writing aside from the following claim on\\ntheir website:8\\nThe Instruct models share our base\\nGPT-3 models’ ability to understand and\\ngenerate natural language, but they’re\\nbetter at understanding and following\\nyour instructions. You simply tell the\\nmodel what you want it to do, and it\\nwill do its best to fulﬁll your instruc-\\ntions. This is an important step forward\\nin our goal of building safe models that\\nare aligned with human interests.\\nCrucially, the Instruct Series is inappropriate for\\nreproducible research because it is unknown what\\ndatasets and prompts these models are trained on,\\nand whether any task categories are systematically\\nheld out as done by Sanh et al. (2021) and Wei et al.\\n(2021). If it is trained on any prompt or dataset of\\nNLI, it would not be zero-shot, making it an un-\\nfair comparison to other models in our experiments.\\nSecond, it is still in beta and its training, held-out,\\nand prompt mixtures could change. At least two\\nInstruct Series models were made available in se-\\nquence during our writing, and it is not clear if we\\nexperiment on an older version, whether it will still\\nbe available and reproducible in the future.\\nB.2\\nPriming vs. Fine-Tuning\\nAs mentioned in Section 3, we use priming (a.k.a.\\nin-context learning) in lieu of ﬁne-tuning because,\\n7OpenAI never actually discloses which one of their com-\\nmercially named ada, babbage, curie, davinci\\n“engines” correspond to models of which size. However, Gao\\net al. (2021a) estimate that they correspond to 350M, 1.3B,\\n6.7B, and 175B respectively.\\n8http://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/instruct-series-beta\\nat the time of writing, OpenAI’s ﬁne-tuning API is\\nlimited to 10 runs per month. To train 30 prompts\\nat only two number of shots would take 6 months,\\nassuming we get hyperparameters right at ﬁrst try.\\nFurther, each training run is limited to a maximum\\nof 5 epochs, which often entails an insufﬁcient\\nnumber steps for few-shot training. We were unable\\nto ﬁne-tune GPT to any reasonable accuracy with\\nour allowed 10 tries in the ﬁrst month. Finally, the\\nﬁne-tuning API is limited to GPT variants up to\\n6.7B, not the 175B model we plan to experiment\\nwith.\\nWith priming, we are able to reproduce Brown\\net al. (2020)’s zero-shot performance on RTE but\\nonly with their exact prompt reported in their Fig-\\nure G.31, all other (even instructive) prompts per-\\nform at random at zero shots, suggesting that their\\nreported prompt is highly cherry-picked. We are\\nunable to reproduce their reported few-shot result\\nbecause they report it at 32 shots, but their API only\\npermits a context length up to 2049 tokens, which\\nis insufﬁcient for RTE. We ﬁnd that 16 shots are\\nthe highest one can reach within the token limit.9\\nLike the gradient updated models, we document\\nthe exact examples we use for few-shot priming in\\nour GitHub repository. Unlike the gradient updated\\nmodels, which are trained on the same k exam-\\nples, priming models use different sets of k prim-\\ning examples for each inference example (Brown\\net al., 2020, p. 20). This means that GPT’s perfor-\\nmance reﬂects the fact that, overall, it has seen far\\nmore than k examples, making it not directly com-\\nparable to the few shots of the gradient updated\\nmodels. This is not ideal, but our GPT few-shot\\nperformance already underperforms what Brown\\net al. (2020) report, so we choose to not further\\nrestrict it to have the same ﬁxed priming examples\\nfor all inference examples, which could run into\\na lack of competence issue (§6.2) that make its\\nresults unusable for our research question.\\nLastly, unlike the gradient updated models, we\\ndo not run multiple seeds with our GPT experi-\\nments because, ﬁrst, they are expensive. As the\\nAPI bills by token, using k shots of priming exam-\\nple effectively multiplies the total cost by k. Sec-\\nond, OpenAI imposes a monthly quota for each lab,\\nso running multiple seeds will take several more\\nmonths to complete.\\n9Depending on the length of the prompt template, 2 or 3\\nexamples still exceed the token limit, in which case we remove\\none priming example, keeping the other 15 priming examples\\nand the to-be-predicted example unmodiﬁed.\\n16\\nB.3\\nOther Tips for Working with GPT-3\\nUsing the logprobs argument in their API, we\\nobtain the top 99 predicted target word and their\\nlog probabilities.10 Following Sanh et al. (2021)\\nand Wei et al. (2021), we evaluate by a rank classi-\\nﬁcation of the target words, i.e., if the gold target\\nword is “yes”, we consider it as correct as long as\\nthe probability of “yes” is higher than that of “no”,\\nregardless of whether “yes” is the top-1 prediction\\ngenerated by the model.\\nAlarmingly, we ﬁnd that these top-99 predictions\\nare semantically inconsistent ranked, e.g., for one\\ndata example and its top-99 word predictions, it is\\noften the case that, e.g., P(yes) > P(no) but P(Yes)\\n< P(No). Thus, the choice of the target words’ sur-\\nface form makes a substantial difference in the\\noverall performance. (Not to mention the prob-\\nlem of choosing between yes/no, true/false, cor-\\nrect/incorrect, etc. as studied in Section 5.) OpenAI\\nrecommends having no trailing space in the input\\nand let the model predict the ﬁrst token with a lead-\\ning space as in “ Yes”. We ﬁnd that although strip-\\nping the leading space sometimes leads to higher\\nperformance for some prompts, overall not apply-\\ning stripping or other token normalization performs\\nthe best.\\nAnother point researchers should pay attention\\nto is the use of what OpenAI calls a “separator”\\ninserted between priming examples. In preliminary\\nexperiments, we initially use newline characters as\\nappeared in Brown et al. (2020)’s Appendix G. We\\nlater discover that OpenAI recommends using ###\\nor \\\\n###\\\\n as separators. We use the latter and\\nﬁnd consistent performance improvement over just\\nusing newline characters, and we use it throughout\\nin our main experiments.\\nC\\nHyperparameters\\nFor encoder-only models, we follow Schick and\\nSchütze (2021b) and Le Scao and Rush (2021)’s\\nrecommendations and use a learning rate of 1e−5.\\nFor T5 and T0 models, we follow Raffel et al.\\n(2020) and Sanh et al. (2021)’s recommendations\\nand use a learning rate of 1e−4. We run sev-\\neral preliminary experiments with learning rates\\n(3e−4, 1e−4, 5e−5, 1e−5) deviating from their rec-\\nommendations and they perform worse, although\\n10Although sometimes the API returns less than the num-\\nber of logprobs the user speciﬁes, in which case we con-\\ntacted OpenAI’s customer support who provided us refund by\\nstore credit. At the time of publishing, OpenAI now restricts\\nlogprobs to a maximum of 5.\\nour search is not exhaustive due to the high cost\\nof running multiple prompts with multiple random\\nseeds.\\nNote that T5 and T0 are trained with the Adafac-\\ntor optimizer (Shazeer and Stern, 2018) in Mesh\\nTensorFlow. Our implementation is in PyTorch, and\\nwe ﬁnd that ﬁne-tuning T5 with PyTorch’s imple-\\nmentation of Adafactor yields substantially worse\\nresults than the usual choice of the AdamW opti-\\nmizer. We corresponded with Raffel et al. (2020),\\nwho advised us that it might be due to the fact that\\nPyTorch does not have the same learning rate sched-\\nuler implementation as TensorFlow’s Adafactor\\ndoes. They recommended us to simply use AdamW,\\nwhich is what we did. This is somewhat unfortunate\\nbecause Adafactor is much more memory efﬁcient,\\nwhich would have drastically reduced the compute\\nresources required and thus enable more compre-\\nhensive experiments of the 11B models, which are\\ncurrently limited to 0 shots and 16 shots only.\\nAlthough most models seem to obtain the high-\\nest validation accuracy at very early epochs, we\\ntrain all models to 30 epochs (20 epochs for 11B\\nmodels) to be safe and select the checkpoint with\\nthe highest validation accuracy.\\nAll models use a batch size of 4 with 4 gradient\\naccumulation steps for an effective batch size of\\n16.\\nNote that because we use a rank classiﬁcation\\nof single-token target words, decoding sampling\\nmethods (e.g., beam search, top-k, top-p) are un-\\nnecessary.\\nWe follow Raffel et al.

All templates use “yes”/“no” as target words for the\\nentailment and non-entailment classes, respectively. For ternary NLI datasets, we use “unclear” for the neutral class,\\nwhich performs best after preliminary experiments with other ternary words: “maybe”, “sometimes”, “perhaps”,\\n“possibly”, and “neither”. Keen readers may notice that some of the instructive templates (e.g., should we\\nassume) do not instruct a strict entailment task. We intentionally wrote a mixture of instructions that asks for\\nstrictly logical entailment and pragmatic inference, intending to measure if models can distinguish between the\\ntwo on datasets such as HANS (McCoy et al., 2019) that magnify different predictions caused by pragmatic effects.\\nOf course, this research question became moot as we found that models cannot even distinguish among much more\\npathological prompts.\\n19\\nF.2\\nAblation Experiment Templates\\ncategory\\ntemplate\\ninstructive sans qmarks\\n{premise} Using only the above description and what you know about the world, {hypothesis}is deﬁnitely correct.

       "  'content': 'Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using\\nModel Parallelism\\nMohammad Shoeybi 1 2 Mostofa Patwary 1 2 Raul Puri 1 2 Patrick LeGresley 2 Jared Casper 2\\nBryan Catanzaro 2\\nAbstract\\nRecent work in language modeling demonstrates\\nthat training large transformer models advances\\nthe state of the art in Natural Language Processing\\napplications. However, very large models can be\\nquite difﬁcult to train due to memory constraints.\\nIn this work, we present our techniques for train-\\ning very large transformer models and implement\\na simple, efﬁcient intra-layer model parallel ap-\\nproach that enables training transformer models\\nwith billions of parameters. Our approach does\\nnot require a new compiler or library changes, is\\northogonal and complimentary to pipeline model\\nparallelism, and can be fully implemented with\\nthe insertion of a few communication operations\\nin native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach\\nby converging transformer based models up to\\n8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sus-\\ntain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire applica-\\ntion with 76% scaling efﬁciency when compared\\nto a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39\\nTeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To\\ndemonstrate that large language models can fur-\\nther advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train\\nan 8.3 billion parameter transformer language\\nmodel similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parame-\\nter model similar to BERT. We show that careful\\nattention to the placement of layer normalization\\nin BERT-like models is critical to achieving in-\\ncreased performance as the model size grows. Us-\\ning the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results\\non the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA per-\\nplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% com-\\npared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our\\nBERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE\\ndataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of\\n89.4%).\\n1Equal contribution 2NVIDIA.

Introduction\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is advancing quickly in\\npart due to an increase in available compute and dataset size.\\nThe abundance of compute and data enables training increas-\\ningly larger language models via unsupervised pretraining\\n(Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019). Empirical evi-\\ndence indicates that larger language models are dramatically\\nmore useful for NLP tasks such as article completion, ques-\\ntion answering, and natural language inference (Lan et al.,\\n2019; Raffel et al., 2019). By ﬁnetuning these pretrained\\nlanguage models on downstream natural language tasks,\\none can achieve state of the art results as shown in recent\\nwork (Devlin et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2018; Howard &\\nRuder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; 2017; Ramachandran\\net al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019b; Dai et al., 2019; Yang et al.,\\n2019; Liu et al., 2019a; Lan et al., 2019).\\nAs these models become larger, they exceed the memory\\nlimit of modern processors, and require additional memory\\nmanagement techniques such as activation checkpointing\\n(Chen et al., 2016). Widely used optimization algorithms\\nsuch as ADAM require additional memory per parameter to\\nstore momentum and other optimizer state, which reduces\\nthe size of models that can be effectively trained. Several\\napproaches to model parallelism overcome this limit by\\npartitioning the model such that the weights and their asso-\\nciated optimizer state do not need to reside concurrently on\\nthe processor. For example, GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) and\\nMesh-Tensorﬂow (Shazeer et al., 2018) provide frameworks\\nfor model parallelism of different kinds. However, they\\nrequire rewriting the model, and rely on custom compilers\\nand frameworks that are still under development.\\nIn this work, we implement a simple and efﬁcient model\\nparallel approach using intra-layer model-parallelism. We\\nexploit the inherent structure in transformer based language\\nmodels to make a simple model-parallel implementation that\\ntrains efﬁciently in PyTorch, with no custom C++ code or\\ncompiler required. This approach is orthogonal to pipeline-\\nbased model parallelism as advocated by approaches such\\nas GPipe (Huang et al., 2018).\\nTo demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we establish\\narXiv:1909.08053v4  [cs.CL]  13 Mar 2020\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\nFigure 1.

Background and Challenges\\n2.1. Neural Language Model Pretraining\\nPretrained language models have become an indispensable\\npart of NLP researchers’ toolkits. Leveraging large corpus\\npretraining to learn robust neural representations of lan-\\nguage is an active area of research that has spanned the\\npast decade. Early examples of pretraining and transferring\\nneural representations of language demonstrated that pre-\\ntrained word embedding tables improve downstream task\\nresults compared to word embedding tables learned from\\nscratch (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Turian\\net al., 2010). Later work advanced research in this area by\\nlearning and transferring neural models that capture contex-\\ntual representations of words (Melamud et al., 2016; Mc-\\nCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2017;\\n2019). Recent parallel work (Ramachandran et al., 2016;\\nHoward & Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al.,\\n2018; Liu et al., 2019b; Dai et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019;\\nLiu et al., 2019a; Lan et al., 2019) further builds upon these\\nideas by not just transferring the language model to extract\\ncontextual word representations, but by also ﬁnetuning the\\nlanguage model in an end to end fashion on downstream\\ntasks. Through these works, the state of the art has advanced\\nfrom transferring just word embedding tables to transferring\\nentire multi-billion parameter language models. This pro-\\ngression of methods has necessitated the need for hardware,\\nsystems techniques, and frameworks that are able to oper-\\nate efﬁciently at scale and satisfy increasing computational\\nneeds. Our work aims to provide the tools necessary to take\\nanother step forward in this trend.\\n2.2. Transformer Language Models and Multi-Head\\nAttention\\nCurrent work in NLP trends towards using transformer mod-\\nels (Vaswani et al., 2017) due to their superior accuracy\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\nFigure 2. Transformer Architecture. Purple blocks correspond to\\nfully connected layers. Each blue block represents a single trans-\\nformer layer that is replicated N times.\\nand compute efﬁciency. The original transformer formula-\\ntion was designed as a machine translation architecture that\\ntransforms an input sequence into another output sequence\\nusing two parts, an Encoder and Decoder. However, recent\\nwork leveraging transformers for language modeling such as\\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)\\nuse only the Encoder or Decoder depending on their needs.\\nThis work explores both a decoder architecture, GPT-2, and\\nan encoder architecture, BERT.\\nFigure 2 shows a schematic diagram of the model we used.\\nWe refer the reader to prior work for a detailed descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin\\net al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019). It is worthwhile to men-\\ntion that both GPT-2 and BERT use GeLU (Hendrycks &\\nGimpel, 2016) nonlinearities and layer normalization (Ba\\net al., 2016) to the input of the multi-head attention and feed\\nforward layers, whereas the original transformer (Vaswani\\net al., 2017) uses ReLU nonlinearities and applies layer\\nnormalization to outputs.\\n2.3. Data and Model Parallelism in Deep Learning\\nThere are two central paradigms for scaling out deep neu-\\nral network training to numerous hardware accelerators:\\ndata parallelism (Valiant, 1990) where a training minibatch\\nis split across multiple workers, and model parallelism in\\nwhich the memory usage and computation of a model is\\ndistributed across multiple workers. By increasing the mini-\\nbatch size proportionally to the number of available work-\\ners (i.e. weak scaling), one observes near linear scaling\\nin training data throughput. However, large batch train-\\ning introduces complications into the optimization process\\nthat can result in reduced accuracy or longer time to conver-\\ngence, offsetting the beneﬁt of increased training throughput\\n(Keskar et al., 2017). Further research (Goyal et al., 2017;\\nYou et al., 2017; 2019) has developed techniques to miti-\\ngate these effects and drive down the training time of large\\nneural networks. To scale out training even further, parallel\\nwork (Chen et al., 2016) has combined data parallelism with\\nactivation checkpointing: recomputing activations in the\\nbackward pass without storing them in the forward pass to\\nreduce memory requirements.\\nHowever, these techniques have one fundamental limitation\\nin the problem size they can tackle: the model must ﬁt\\nentirely on one worker. With language models of increasing\\nsize and complexity like BERT and GPT-2, neural networks\\nhave approached the memory capacity of modern hardware\\naccelerators. One solution to this problem is to employ\\nparameter sharing to reduce the memory footprint of the\\nmodel (Lan et al., 2019), but this limits the overall capacity\\nof the model. Our approach is to utilize model parallelism\\nto split the model across multiple accelerators. This not\\nonly alleviates the memory pressure, but also increases the\\namount of parallelism independently of the microbatch size.\\nWithin model parallelism, there are two further paradigms:\\nlayer-wise pipeline parallelism, and more general distributed\\ntensor computation. In pipeline model parallelism, groups\\nof operations are performed on one device before the outputs\\nare passed to the next device in the pipeline where a differ-\\nent group of operations are performed. Some approaches\\n(Harlap et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018) use a parameter\\nserver (Li et al., 2014) in conjunction with pipeline par-\\nallelism. However these suffer from inconsistency issues.\\nThe GPipe framework for TensorFlow (Huang et al., 2018)\\novercomes this inconsistency issue by using synchronous\\ngradient decent. This approach requires additional logic to\\nhandle the efﬁcient pipelining of these communication and\\ncomputation operations, and suffers from pipeline bubbles\\nthat reduce efﬁciency, or changes to the optimizer itself\\nwhich impact accuracy.\\nDistributed tensor computation is an orthogonal and more\\ngeneral approach that partitions a tensor operation across\\nmultiple devices to accelerate computation or increase\\nmodel size. FlexFlow (Jia et al., 2018), a deep learning\\nframework orchestrating such parallel computation, pro-\\nvides a method to pick the best parallelization strategy. Re-\\ncently, Mesh-TensorFlow (Shazeer et al., 2018) introduced\\na language for specifying a general class of distributed ten-\\nsor computations in TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015). The\\nparallel dimensions are speciﬁed in the language by the\\nend user and the resulting graph is compiled with proper\\ncollective primitives. We utilize similar insights to those\\nleveraged in Mesh-TensorFlow and exploit parallelism in\\ncomputing the transformer’s attention heads to parallelize\\nour transformer model. However, rather than implementing\\na framework and compiler for model parallelism, we make\\nonly a few targeted modiﬁcations to existing PyTorch trans-\\nformer implementations. Our approach is simple, does not\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\nrequire any new compiler or code re-writing, and can be\\nfully implemented by inserting a few simple primitives, as\\ndescribed in the next section.\\n3. Model Parallel Transformers\\nWe take advantage of the structure of transformer networks\\nto create a simple model parallel implementation by adding a\\nfew synchronization primitives. A transformer layer consists\\nof a self attention block followed by a two-layer, multi-layer\\nperceptron (MLP) as shown in Figure 2. We introduce\\nmodel parallelism in both of these blocks separately.\\nWe start by detailing the MLP block. The ﬁrst part of the\\nblock is a GEMM followed by a GeLU nonlinearity:\\nY = GeLU(XA)\\n(1)\\nOne option to parallelize the GEMM is to split the weight\\nmatrix A along its rows and input X along its columns as:\\nX = [X1, X2], A =\\n\\x14A1\\nA2\\n\\x15\\n.\\n(2)\\nThis partitioning will result in Y\\n=\\nGeLU(X1A1 +\\nX2A2). Since GeLU is a nonlinear function, GeLU(X1A1+\\nX2A2) ̸= GeLU(X1A1)+GeLU(X2A2) and this approach\\nwill require a synchronization point before the GeLU func-\\ntion.\\nAnother option is to split A along its columns A = [A1, A2].\\nThis partitioning allows the GeLU nonlinearity to be inde-\\npendently applied to the output of each partitioned GEMM:\\n[Y1, Y2] = [GeLU(XA1), GeLU(XA2)]\\n(3)\\nThis is advantageous as it removes a synchronization point.\\nHence, we partition the ﬁrst GEMM in this column parallel\\nfashion and split the second GEMM along its rows so it takes\\nthe output of the GeLU layer directly without requiring any\\ncommunication as shown in Figure 3a. The output of the\\nsecond GEMM is then reduced across the GPUs before\\npassing the output to the dropout layer. This approach splits\\nboth GEMMs in the MLP block across GPUs and requires\\nonly a single all-reduce operation in the forward pass (g\\noperator) and a single all-reduce in the backward pass (f\\noperator). These two operators are conjugates of each other\\nand can be implemented in PyTorch with only a few lines of\\ncode. As an example, the implementation of the f operator\\nis provided below:\\nclass f(torch.autograd.Function):\\ndef forward(ctx, x):\\nreturn x\\ndef backward(ctx, gradient):\\nall_reduce(gradient)\\nreturn gradient\\nCode 1. Implementation of f operator. g is similar to f with\\nidentity in the backward and all-reduce in the forward\\nfunctions.\\n(a) MLP\\n(b) Self-Attention\\nFigure 3. Blocks of Transformer with Model Parallelism. f and g\\nare conjugate. f is an identity operator in the forward pass and all\\nreduce in the backward pass while g is an all reduce in the forward\\npass and identity in the backward pass.\\nAs shown in Figure 3b, for the self attention block we exploit\\ninherent parallelism in the multihead attention operation,\\npartitioning the GEMMs associated with key (K), query\\n(Q), and value (V ) in a column parallel fashion such that\\nthe matrix multiply corresponding to each attention head is\\ndone locally on one GPU. This allows us to split per atten-\\ntion head parameters and workload across the GPUs, and\\ndoesnt require any immediate communication to complete\\nthe self-attention. The subsequent GEMM from the output\\nlinear layer (after self attention) is parallelized along its\\nrows and takes the output of the parallel attention layer di-\\nrectly, without requiring communication between the GPUs.\\nThis approach for both the MLP and self attention layer\\nfuses groups of two GEMMs, eliminates a synchronization\\npoint in between, and results in better scaling. This enables\\nus to perform all GEMMs in a simple transformer layer\\nusing only two all-reduces in the forward path and two in\\nthe backward path (see Figure 4).\\nThe transformer language model has an output embedding\\nwith the dimension of hidden-size (H) times vocabulary-\\nsize (v). Since the vocabulary size is on the order of tens\\nof thousands of tokens for modern language models (for\\nexample, GPT-2 used a vocabulary size of 50,257), it is ben-\\neﬁcial to parallelize the output embedding GEMM. How-\\never, in transformer language models, the output embed-\\nding layer shares weights with the input embedding, requir-\\ning modiﬁcations to both. We parallelize the input embed-\\nding weight matrix EH×v along the vocabulary dimension\\nE = [E1, E2] (column-wise). Since each partition now only\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\nFigure 4. Communication operations in a transformer layer. There\\nare 4 total communication operations in the forward and backward\\npass of a single model parallel transformer layer.\\ncontains a portion of the embedding table, an all-reduce (g\\noperator) is required after the input embedding. For the\\noutput embedding, one approach is to perform the parallel\\nGEMM [Y1, Y2] = [XE1, XE2] to obtain the logits, add an\\nall-gather Y = all-gather([Y1, Y2]), and send the results to\\nthe cross-entropy loss function. However, for this case, the\\nall-gather will communicate b × s × v elements (b is the\\nbatch-size and s is the sequence length) which is huge due to\\nvocabulary size being large. To reduce the communication\\nsize, we fuse the output of the parallel GEMM [Y1, Y2] with\\nthe cross entropy loss which reduces the dimension to b × s.\\nCommunicating scalar losses instead of logits is a huge re-\\nduction in communication that improves the efﬁciency of\\nour model parallel approach.\\nMuch of our model parallel approach can be characterized\\nas techniques aimed at reducing communication and keep-\\ning the GPUs compute bound. Rather than having one GPU\\ncompute part of the dropout, layer normalization, or residual\\nconnections and broadcast the results to other GPUs, we\\nchoose to duplicate the computation across GPUs. Speciﬁ-\\ncally, we maintain duplicate copies of layer normalization\\nparameters on each GPU, and take the output of the model\\nparallel region and run dropout and residual connection\\non these tensors before feeding them as input to the next\\nmodel parallel regions. To optimize the model we allow\\neach model parallel worker to optimize its own set of pa-\\nrameters. Since all values are either local to or duplicated\\non a GPU, there is no need for communicating updated\\nparameter values in this formulation.\\nWe present further details about the hybrid model and data\\nparallelism and handling random number generation in Ap-\\npendix B for reference. In summary, our approach as de-\\nscribed above is simple to implement, requiring only a few\\nextra all-reduce operations added to the forward and back-\\nward pass. It does not require a compiler, and is orthogonal\\nand complementary to the pipeline model parallelism advo-\\ncated by approaches such as (Huang et al., 2018).\\n4. Setup\\nPretrained language understanding models are central tasks\\nin natural language processing and language understanding.\\nThere are several formulations of language modeling. In\\nthis work we focus on GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), a left-\\nto-right generative transformer based language model, and\\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2018), a bi-directional transformer\\nmodel based on language model masking. We explain our\\nconﬁgurations for these models in the following section and\\nrefer to the original papers for more details.\\n4.1. Training Dataset\\nTo collect a large diverse training set with longterm de-\\npendencies we aggregate several of the largest language\\nmodeling datasets. We create an aggregate dataset consist-\\ning of Wikipedia (Devlin et al., 2018), CC-Stories (Trinh &\\nLe, 2018), RealNews (Zellers et al., 2019), and OpenWeb-\\ntext (Radford et al., 2019). To avoid training set leakage\\ninto our downstream tasks we remove the Wikipedia articles\\npresent in the WikiText103 test set (Merity et al., 2016).\\nWe also remove unnecessary newlines from the CC-Stories\\ncorpus introduced by preprocessing artifacts. For BERT\\nmodels we include BooksCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015) in the\\ntraining dataset, however, this dataset is excluded for GPT-2\\ntrainings as it overlaps with LAMBADA task.\\nWe combined all the datasets and then ﬁltered out all the\\ndocuments with content length less than 128 tokens from\\nthe aggregated dataset. Since similar content might appear\\nmultiple times in the aggregated datasets, we used locality-\\nsensitive hashing (LSH) to deduplicate content with a jac-\\ncard similarity greater than 0.7. The resulting aggregate\\ncorpus contains 174 GB of deduplicated text.\\n4.2. Training Optimization and Hyperparameters\\nTo train our models efﬁciently we utilize mixed precision\\ntraining with dynamic loss scaling to take advantage of the\\nV100’s Tensor Cores (Micikevicius et al., 2017; NVIDIA,\\n2018). We start by initializing our weights W with a sim-\\nple normal distribution W ∼N(0, 0.02). We then scale\\nweights immediately before residual layers by\\n1\\n√\\n2N where\\nN is the number of transformer layers comprised of self at-\\ntention and MLP blocks. For our optimizer we utilize Adam\\n(Kingma & Ba, 2014) with weight decay (Loshchilov &\\nHutter, 2019) λ = 0.01. Additionally, we use global gradi-\\nent norm clipping of 1.0 to improve the stability of training\\nlarge models. In all cases, a dropout of 0.1 is used. Lastly,\\nto better manage our memory footprint we utilize activation\\ncheckpointing (Chen et al., 2016) after every transformer\\nlayer.\\nFor GPT-2 models, all training is performed with sequences\\nof 1024 subword units at a batch size of 512 for 300k itera-\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\ntions. Our learning rate of 1.5e-4 utilizes a warmup period\\nof 3k iterations before following a single cycle cosine decay\\nover the remaining 297k iterations. We stop the decay at a\\nminimum learning rate of 1e-5.\\nFor BERT models, we largely follow the training process\\ndescribed in (Lan et al., 2019). We use the original BERT\\ndictionary with vocab size of 30,522. In addition, we re-\\nplace the next sentence prediction head with sentence order\\nprediction as suggested by (Lan et al., 2019) and use whole\\nword n-gram masking of (Joshi et al., 2019). For all cases,\\nwe set the batch size to 1024 and use a learning rate of 1.0e-\\n4 warmed up over 10,000 iterations and decayed linearly\\nover 2 million iterations. Other training parameters are kept\\nthe same as (Devlin et al., 2018).\\n5. Experiments\\nAll of our experiments use up to 32 DGX-2H servers (a total\\nof 512 Tesla V100 SXM3 32GB GPUs). Our infrastruc-\\nture is optimized for multi-node deep learning applications,\\nwith 300 GB/sec bandwidth between GPUs inside a server\\nvia NVSwitch and 100 GB/sec of interconnect bandwidth\\nbetween servers using 8 InﬁniBand adapters per server.\\n5.1. Scaling Analysis\\nTo test the scalability of our implementation, we consider\\nGPT-2 models with four sets of parameters detailed in Table\\n1. To have consistent GEMM sizes in the self attention layer,\\nthe hidden size per attention head is kept constant at 96\\nwhile the number of heads and layers are varied to obtain\\nconﬁgurations ranging from 1 billion to 8 billion parameters.\\nThe conﬁguration with 1.2 billion parameters ﬁts on a single\\nGPU whereas the 8 billion parameter model requires 8-way\\nmodel parallelism (8 GPUs). The original vocabulary size\\nwas 50,257, however, to have efﬁcient GEMMs for the logit\\nlayer, it is beneﬁcial for the per-GPU vocabulary size to\\nbe a multiple of 128. Since we study up to 8-way model\\nparallelism, we pad the vocabulary such that it is divisible\\nby 128 × 8 = 1024, resulting in a padded vocabulary size\\nof 51,200. We study both model and model+data parallel\\nscaling. For the model parallel scaling, a ﬁxed batch size of\\n8 is used across all conﬁgurations. Data parallel scaling is\\nnecessary for training many state of the art models which\\ntypically use a much larger global batch size. To this end,\\nfor the model+data parallel cases we ﬁx the global batch\\nsize to 512 for all experiments which corresponds to 64-way\\ndata parallelism.\\n5.1.1. MODEL AND DATA PARALLELISM\\nThroughout this section, we will showcase weak scaling\\nwith respect to the model parameters for both model parallel\\nand model+data parallel cases.

In contrast, here we use weak scaling to\\ntrain larger models that were not possible otherwise. The\\nbaseline for all the scaling numbers is the ﬁrst conﬁguration\\n(1.2 billion parameters) in Table 1 running on a single GPU.\\nThis is a strong baseline as it achieves 39 TeraFLOPS during\\nthe overall training process, which is 30% of the theoretical\\npeak FLOPS for a single GPU in a DGX-2H server.\\nFigure 5 shows scaling values for both model and\\nmodel+data parallelism. We observe excellent scaling num-\\nbers in both settings. For example, the 8.3 billion parame-\\nters case with 8-way (8 GPU) model parallelism achieves\\n77% of linear scaling. Model+data parallelism requires fur-\\nther communication of gradients and as a result the scaling\\nnumbers drop slightly. However, even for the largest conﬁg-\\nuration (8.3 billion parameters) running on 512 GPUs, we\\nachieve 74% scaling relative to linear scaling of the strong\\nsingle GPU baseline conﬁguration (1.2 billion parameters).\\nFurther scaling analysis is provided in Appendix D\\n5.2. Language Modeling Results Using GPT-2\\nTo demonstrate that large language models can further ad-\\nvance the state of the art, we consider training GPT-2 models\\nof the sizes and conﬁgurations listed in Table 2. The 355M\\nmodel is equivalent in size and conﬁguration of BERT-Large\\nmodel (Devlin et al., 2018). The 2.5B model is bigger than\\nthe previous largest GPT-2 model, and the 8.3B model is\\nlarger than any left-to-right transformer language model\\never trained, to the best of our knowledge.

Table 2 also lists the time it takes to advance one\\nepoch which is equivalent to 68,507 iterations. For example,\\nfor the 8.3B model on 512 GPUs, each epoch takes around\\ntwo days. Compared to the conﬁgurations used for our scal-\\ning studies in Table 1, the 2.5B model is the same, the 8.3B\\nmodel has 24 attention heads instead of 32, and the 355M is\\nmuch smaller than any seen previously while still using 64\\nGPUs to train, leading to the much lower time per epoch.\\nFigure 6 shows validation perpelixity as a function of num-\\nber of iterations. As the model size increases, the validation\\nperpelixity decreases and reaches a validation perplexity of\\n9.27 for the 8.3B model. We report the zero-shot evaluation\\nof the trained models on the LAMBADA and WikiText103\\ndatasets in Table 3. For more details on evaluation method-\\nology, see Appendix E. We observe the trend that increasing\\nmodel size also leads to lower perplexity on WikiText103\\nand higher cloze accuracy on LAMBADA. Our 8.3B model\\nachieves state of the art perplexity on the WikiText103 test\\nset at a properly adjusted perplexity of 10.81. At 66.51%\\naccuracy, the 8.3B model similarly surpasses prior cloze\\naccuracy results on the LAMBADA task. We have included\\nsamples generated from the 8.3 billion parameters model\\nin the Appendix C.

Bi-directional Transformer Results Using BERT\\nIn this section, we apply our methodology to BERT-style\\ntransformer models and study the effect of model scaling\\non several downstream tasks. Prior work (Lan et al., 2019)\\nfound that increasing model size beyond BERT-large with\\n336M parameters results in unexpected model degradation.\\nTo address this degradation, the authors of that work (Lan\\net al., 2019) introduced parameter sharing and showed that\\nthat their models scale much better compared to the original\\nBERT model.\\nWe further investigated this behaviour and empirically\\ndemonstrated that rearranging the order of the layer nor-\\nmalization and the residual connections as shown in Figure\\n7 is critical to enable the scaling of the BERT-style mod-\\nels beyond BERT-Large. The architecture (b) in Figure 7\\neliminates instabilities observed using the original BERT\\narchitecture in (a) and also has a lower training loss. To\\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to report such a\\nchange enables training larger BERT models.\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\nTable 5.

Training loss for BERT model using the original architec-\\nture (a) and the rearranged architecture (b). Left ﬁgure shows the\\ntraining loss for 336M and 752M BERT model. While the original\\narchitecture performs well on the 336M model, the modiﬁcations\\nin (b) enable stable training with lower training loss.\\nUsing the architecture change in Figure 7(b), we consider\\nthree different cases as detailed in Table 4. The 336M model\\nhas the same size as BERT-large. The 1.3B is the same as\\nthe BERT-xlarge conﬁguration that was previously shown\\nto get worse results than the 336M BERT-large model (Lan\\net al., 2019). We further scale the BERT model using both\\nlarger hidden size as well as more layers to arrive at the 3.9B\\nparameter case. In all cases, the hidden size per attention\\nhead is kept constant at 64. 336M and 1.3B models are\\ntrained for 2 million iterations while the 3.9B model is\\ntrained for 1.5 million iterations and is still training.\\nOn a 3% held-out set, 336M, 1.3B, and 3.9B models achieve\\nvalidation set perplexity of 1.58, 1.30, and 1.16, respectively,\\na monotonic decrease with the model size. We ﬁnetune\\nthe trained models on several downstream tasks including\\nMNLI and QQP from the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al.,\\n2019), SQuAD 1.1 and SQuAD 2.0 from the Stanford Ques-\\ntion answering dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; 2018), and\\nthe reading comprehension RACE dataset (Lai et al., 2017).\\nFor ﬁnetuning, we follow the same procedure as (Liu et al.,\\n2019b). We ﬁrst perform hyperparameter tuning on batch\\nsize and learning rate. Once we obtain the best values, we\\nreport the median development set results over 5 different\\nrandom seeds for initialization. The hyperparameters used\\nfor each model and task are provided in the Appendix A.\\nTable 5 shows the development set results for MNLI, QQP,\\nSQuAD 1.1, and SQuAD 2.0 and test set results for RACE.\\nFor the test set results of RACE, we ﬁrst use the develop-\\nment set to ﬁnd the checkpoint that gives us the median\\nscore on the 5 random seeds and we report the results from\\nthat checkpoint on the test set. We also report 5-way ensem-\\nble results for the development set of SQuAD and test set\\nof RACE. From Table 5 we observe that (a) as the model\\nsize increases, the downstream task performance improves\\nin all cases, (b) our 3.9B model establishes state of the art\\nresults on the development set compared to other BERT\\nbased models, and (c) our 3.9B model achieves both single\\nmodel as well as ensembled SOTA results on RACE test set.\\n6. Conclusion and Future Work\\nIn this work, we successfully surpassed the limitations posed\\nby traditional single-GPU-per-model training by implement-\\ning model parallelism with only a few modiﬁcations to\\nthe existing PyTorch transformer implementations. We ef-\\nﬁciently trained transformer based models up to 8.3 bil-\\nlion parameter on 512 NVIDIA V100 GPUs with 8-way\\nmodel parallelism and achieved up to 15.1 PetaFLOPs sus-\\ntained over the entire application. We also showed that for\\nBERT models, careful attention to the placement of layer\\nnormalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving\\nincreased accuracies as the model size increases. We study\\nthe effect of model size on down-stream task accuracy and\\nachieve far superior results on downstream tasks and estab-\\nlish new SOTA for WikiText103, LAMBADA, and RACE\\ndatasets. Finally, we open sourced our code to enable future\\nwork leveraging model parallel transformers.\\nThere are several directions for future work. Continuing\\nto increase the scale of pretraining is a promising line of\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\ninvestigation that will further test existing deep learning\\nhardware and software. To realize this, improvements in\\nthe efﬁciency and memory footprint of optimizers will be\\nneeded. In addition, training a model with more than 16\\nbillion parameters will demand more memory than is avail-\\nable within 16 GPUs of a DGX-2H box. For such models, a\\nhybrid intra-layer and inter-layer model parallelism along\\nwith inter-node model parallelism would be more suitable.\\nThree other directions of investigation include (a) pretrain-\\ning different model families (XLNet, T5), (b) evaluating per-\\nformance of large models across more difﬁcult and diverse\\ndownstream tasks (e.g. Generative Question Answering,\\nSummarization, and Conversation), and (c) using knowl-\\nedge distillation to train small student models from these\\nlarge pretrained teacher models.\\nReferences\\nAbadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z.,\\nCitro, C., Corrado, G.

Model Parallel Supplementary Material\\nIn this section, we present further details about the hybrid\\nmodel and data parallelism and handling random number\\ngeneration.\\nB.1. Hybrid Model and Data Parallelism\\nModel parallelism is orthogonal to data parallelism, and so\\nwe can use both simultaneously to train large models in a\\nreasonable amount of time. Figure 8 shows a grouping of\\nGPUs for hybrid model and data parallelism. Two or more\\nGPUs within the same server form model parallel groups\\n(for example GPUs 1 to 8 in Figure 8), and contain one\\nTable 6.

The\\nremaining GPUs, which could be within the same server but\\nmore typically are located in other servers, run additional\\nmodel parallel groups. GPUs with the same position in each\\nof the model parallel groups (for example GPUs 1, 9, ...,\\n505 in Figure 8) form data parallel groups so that all GPUs\\nwithin a data parallel group hold the same model param-\\neters. During back propagation we run multiple gradient\\nall-reduce operations in parallel to reduce weight gradients\\nwithin each distinct data parallel group. The total number\\nof required GPUs is the product of the number of model\\nand data parallel groups. For example, for the 8.3 billion\\nparameter model we use 8 GPUs per model parallel group\\nand 64-way data parallelism, for a total of 512 GPUs. All\\ncommunication is implemented in PyTorch by Python calls\\nto NCCL. GPUs within each model parallel group perform\\nall-reduces amongst all GPUs within the group. For data\\nparallelism, each of the all-reduce operations takes place\\nwith one of the GPUs from each model parallel group.\\nB.2. Model Parallel Random Number Generation\\nTechniques that utilize random number generation, such\\nas dropout, are a staple of modern deep learning training.\\nTransformers have dropout layers outside the model parallel\\nregions before residual connections and within model paral-\\nlel regions in the self attention block. Because some dropout\\nlayers are in a model parallel region, while others are not,\\nwe need to treat random number generation carefully to\\nensure dropout works correctly. To synchronize residual\\nconnection dropout across model parallel workers we seed\\nthe random number generators at the beginning of training\\nwith the same seed. This results in identical dropout patterns\\nacross all model parallel workers. However, dropout within\\na model parallel region should result in different random\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\npatterns for each worker to achieve randomness across the\\nentire operation. To achieve this we maintain a separate\\nrandom number generator for dropout within model parallel\\nregions. This random number generator is uniquely seeded\\nfor each model parallel worker.\\nFigure 8. Grouping of GPUs for hybrid model and data parallelism\\nwith 8-way model parallel and 64-way data parallel.\\nC. Text Samples\\nBelow are some text samples generated by Megatron-LM\\nusing a context prompt. Some of the texts are cut short.\\nContext: There is a major force uniting Americas ﬁercely\\npartisan politicians: big technology companies. Democrats\\nand Republicans at the federal and state levels are coming\\ntogether to scrutinize the power of the Silicon Valley giants\\nand, potentially, to rein them in. Letitia James, the Demo-\\ncratic attorney general of New York, announced on Friday\\nthat attorneys general in eight states four Democrats and\\nfour Republicans and the District of Columbia had begun\\nan antitrust investigation of Facebook.\\nMegatron-LM: The probe, which Ms. James said was\\nlikely to result in a lawsuit, is the latest in a string of high-\\nproﬁle regulatory actions, in state and federal courts, that\\nchallenge the market dominance of tech companies. The\\nJustice Department is also investigating Facebook’s data\\npractices and whether the company violated a 2011 consent\\ndecree with the Federal Trade Commission that required\\nthe company to obtain explicit consent from users before\\nsharing their personal information with third parties.\\nWhat might prompt a bipartisan coalition to sue Facebook?\\nIt isn’t clear that there’s any one thing. But lawmakers and\\nregulators have been increasingly alarmed by the company’s\\nrecent controversies, which include a data breach affecting\\nmore than 50 million users, the spread of fake news on\\nthe platform, and the spreading of propaganda by Russian-\\nbacked accounts during the 2016 election.\\nIt’s also not clear how serious the Democratic attorneys gen-\\neral are about ﬁling a lawsuit. While the attorneys general\\nannounced their investigation in a press release, they said\\nthey had not yet reached a decision on whether to sue. In\\nthe past, some of the attorneys general have focused their\\nefforts on trying to extract settlements from the tech compa-\\nnies without ﬁling lawsuits.\\n”As attorneys general who have investigated and prosecuted\\nhealth-care fraud, price-ﬁxing, and other violations of our\\nstates’ antitrust laws, we are committed to holding compa-\\nnies accountable when they fail to protect consumers and\\ncompetition in the market,” Ms. James said in a statement.\\nThe investigation, which was ﬁrst reported by The New\\nYork Times, was announced as the companies that dom-\\ninate the tech industry are facing scrutiny from antitrust\\nregulators around the world. Google, Twitter, Facebook\\nand Amazon have faced a series of antitrust probes and\\nclass-action lawsuits in the United States and Europe ...\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\nContext: A ﬂower, sometimes known as a bloom or\\nblossom, is the reproductive structure found in ﬂowering\\nplants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called\\nangiosperms). The biological function of a ﬂower is to ef-\\nfect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the\\nunion of sperm with eggs.\\nMegatron-LM: The structural components of the ﬂower\\nare the petals and sepals, which are the reproductive organs,\\nthe hypanthium, which forms the base of the ﬂower, and\\nthe calyx, which is the stigma. A ﬂower is a composite\\nstructure, made up of sepals and petals, the sepals being\\ncomposed of three fused tepals and the petals of two fused\\npetals, though there are a few exceptions to this rule. The\\nthree sepals are fused to form a tube called the calyx, which\\nis the structure that attracts the pollinating insects. The\\npetals are composed of two fused sepals (the outer ones)\\nwhich open and fold inward (clasp) at the tips, forming\\nthe petals. The four sepals and petals are united to form\\na corolla, the outermost structure of a ﬂower that carries\\npollen.\\nThe structure of the ﬂower has important functional signif-\\nicance, including protection of the ovary from insects and\\nthe transfer of pollen between the male and female parts\\nof a ﬂower. The structure of the ﬂower is also used by the\\nplants to attract pollinators, for example by the shape of the\\npetals and the colours of the stamens.\\nThe structure of a ﬂower varies widely between plants. The\\nsimplest ﬂowers are unbranched and made up of only two\\nsepals and a single petal. Other examples are composed\\nof several petals joined together, with the innermost sepals\\ncompletely fused to form a tube called the calyx. The petals\\nare usually coloured to attract insects, which can only see\\ncertain wavelengths of light. The sepals are often coloured\\ntoo, but usually have a more limited range of colours.\\nSome ﬂowers have additional structures, such as stamens,\\nanthers and ovaries. The presence of stamens and anthers\\nin some ﬂowers is used for cross-pollination. The ovary is\\nthe organ where the female gametes are produced, and is\\nthe ﬁrst structure that is developed in an embryo of a ﬂower.\\nThe ovary is the female ﬂower’s reproductive system, and\\nconsists of the ovary wall, the ovule, and the oviduct.\\nFlowers vary in their size and shape, from tiny to huge, and\\nare often brightly coloured.

Although\\nnot as powerful as the large model, the smaller version still\\nhas some language generation chops.\\nMegatron-LM: In December 2016, DeepMind released an\\neven larger model, GPT-3, with more than 1.5 billion pa-\\nrameters. DeepMind has no plans to release the model, so\\nthe question remains whether other AI researchers will be\\nable to copy and build on it.\\nOther language models have been built using other tech-\\nniques. In 2016, a team of researchers at Columbia Uni-\\nversity, the University of Toronto, and Google DeepMind\\nshowed that neural network-based models, including deep\\nneural networks, can learn the grammatical rules of a lan-\\nguage. A group at Google DeepMind demonstrated that\\nthese rules could be represented in a network as a kind of\\ndecision tree, where the nodes in the tree are the words in\\nthe sentence, and the rules for the words are represented\\nby the decision nodes at the end of the tree. The network\\nwould go through the network in order to choose the next\\nword in the sentence based on whether it follows the rules\\nor not. In 2017, the team at DeepMind released a paper\\ndetailing the training and performance of their model.\\nThe problems with the model are many. One of the biggest\\nissues is that grammatical rules are ambiguous. For exam-\\nple, the phrase ”I came down” could mean I came down\\nfrom the stairs, or I came down from the sky. In English,\\nthere are numerous other examples of sentences that are\\nambiguous. The model does not have any way to tell the dif-\\nference between the ambiguous sentences, and so it simply\\nmakes a prediction about the entire sentence based on what\\nrules it does know. This makes the model vulnerable to the\\nphenomenon of overﬁtting. In order to avoid this, models\\nmust be trained using a large set of data, so that the model\\ncan ﬁnd useful patterns in the data, and use those patterns\\nto help make predictions. This approach is also prone to\\nerrors, as it relies on the training data to help make correct\\npredictions, and the data might be incorrectly labeled, re-\\nsulting in a model that produces a poor set of predictions.\\nIn the case of GPT-2, the model only has about 100 training\\nsentences for each type of phrase (subject-verb-object).\\nAdditionally, languages have different rules for different\\ntypes of phrasing. In English, the subject-verb-object con-\\nstruction is fairly universal, but other languages have differ-\\nent rules, which makes training a GPT more complicated.\\nFinally, there is an inherent trade-off between the number\\nof rules and the performance of the model ...\\nMegatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\\nContext: The 36th International Conference on Machine\\nLearning (ICML 2019) will be held in Long Beach, CA,\\nUSA from June 10th to June 15th, 2019.

Further Scaling Analysis\\nIn this section we study the effect of number of attention\\nheads on the scaling results. We also present strong scaling\\nresults for our 1.2 billion parameter model.\\nD.1. Attention Heads and Scaling\\nThis section studies the effect of attention heads on model\\nparallel scaling. To this end, we consider the 8.3 billion\\nparameter conﬁguration with 8-way model parallelism and\\nvary the number of heads from 16 to 32. The results are\\npresented in Table 7. As the number of attention heads\\nincreases, some of the GEMMS inside the self-attention\\nlayer become smaller and also the number of elements in\\nthe self attention softmax increases. This results in a slight\\ndecrease in scaling efﬁciency. Future research should be\\nwary of this hyperparameter to design large transformer\\nmodels that balance model speed and model accuracy.\\nD.2.

The\\nresults are listed in Table 8. Using two GPUs makes training\\n64% faster. Above that we see diminishing returns as the\\nper-GPU computation decreases and the memory bandwidth\\nand communication overheads begin to dominate.\\nE. Evaluating Language Models Using\\nWikiText103 and LAMBADA\\nIn this section we detail our evaluation methodology for the\\nWikiText103 dataset (Merity et al., 2016) and cloze-style\\nprediction accuracy on the LAMBADA dataset(Paperno\\net al., 2016).\\nE.1. Wikitext103 Perplexity\\nWikiText103 perplexity is an evaluation criterion that has\\nbeen well studied over the past few years since the creation\\nof the benchmark dataset. Perplexity is the exponentiation\\nof the average cross entropy of a corpus (Mikolov et al.,\\n2011). This makes it a natural evaluation metric for lan-\\nguage models which represent a probability distribution\\nover entire sentences or texts.\\nPPL = exp(−1\\nTo\\nT\\nX\\nt\\nlogP(t|0 : t −1))\\n(4)\\nTo calculate perplexity in (4) we tokenize the WikiText103\\ntest corpus according to our subword vocabulary and sum\\nthe cross entropy loss from each token [0, T]. We then nor-\\nmalize the cross entropy loss by the number of tokens in the\\noriginal tokenization scheme To. The WikiText103 test cor-\\npus already comes pre-tokenized with word level tokens that\\nprior works have used to compute perplexity. To evaluate\\nour models’ perplexities on a level playing ﬁeld with prior\\nworks we must normalize by the original number of tokens,\\nTo, rather than the number of tokens, T, actually in the tok-\\nenized data fed as input to our model. This pre-tokenization\\nalso introduces artifacts in the text that are not present in our\\ntraining data. To alleviate this distributional mismatch, we\\nﬁrst preprocess the WikiText103 test dataset with invertible\\ndetokenizers to remove various artifacts related to punctua-\\ntion and whitespace. The value of To is calculated before\\nthis preprocessing. For WikiText103’s test set To = 245566\\nand T = 270329.\\nWe must also make one further transformer-speciﬁc mod-\\niﬁcation to the perplexity calculation. Unlike RNN-based\\nlanguage models, transformers operate on a ﬁxed window in-\\nput size. Therefore they cannot fully calculate P(t|0 : t−1)\\nand can only calculate P(t|t −w : t −1) where w is the\\nsize of our context: 1024 tokens. However, calculating this\\nvalue for every token in our dataset is prohibitively expen-\\nsive since we must compute approximately T evaluations\\nof a w sized context. To evaluate our models efﬁciently we\\ntake a middle ground approach termed overlapping evalu-\\nation where we advance the sliding window by some over-\\nlap o each time and only compute the cross entropy losses\\ncorresponding to the last o tokens of the window. In our\\nexperiments we utilize an overlap o of 32, and compute\\nlosses over all sliding windows in such a fashion.\\nE.2. LAMBADA Cloze Accuracy\\nThe capability to handle long term contexts is crucial for\\nstate of the art language models and is a necessary prerequi-\\nsite for problems like long-form generation and document-\\nbased question answering. Cloze-style datasets like LAM-\\nBADA are designed to measure a model’s ability to operate\\nin and reason about these types of long term contexts. Cloze-\\nstyle reading comprehension uses a context of word tokens\\nx = x1:t with one token xj masked; the models objective\\nis to correctly predict the value of the missing jth token. To\\naccurately predict the missing token, the model requires an\\nin-depth understanding of the surrounding context and how\\nlanguage should be used in such a context. LAMBADA\\nuses cloze-style reading comprehension to test generative\\nleft-to-right language models by constructing examples of 4-\\n5 sentences where the last word in the context xt is masked.\\nOur models utilize subword units, so for LAMBADA evalu-\\nation we utilize the raw, unprocessed LAMBADA dataset\\nand require that our model predict the multiple subword\\ntokens that make up the word token. We use teacher forc-\\ning, and consider an answer correct only when all output\\npredictions are correct. This formulation is equivalent to the\\noriginal task of word token prediction.\\n'},\n",

The test\\ncovers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science,\\nlaw, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive\\nworld knowledge and problem solving ability. We ﬁnd that while most recent\\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and\\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et al.,\\n2019). About a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level\\n(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\\nof language understanding.\\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see\\nextensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP\\nbenchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are\\nat learning and applying knowledge from many domains.\\nTo bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the\\nexisting measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse\\nset of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during\\npretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the\\nbenchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers\\n57 subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in difﬁculty from\\nan elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem\\nsolving ability. Subjects range from traditional areas, such as mathematics and history, to more\\n1\\narXiv:2009.03300v3  [cs.CY]  12 Jan 2021\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\\nFew Shot Prompt and Predicted Answer\\nHow many numbers are in the list 25, 26, ..., 100?\\n(A) 75 (B) 76 (C) 22 (D) 23\\nAnswer: B\\nCompute i + i2+ i3+ ··· + i 258+ i259.\\n(A) -1 (B) 1 (C) i (D) -i\\nAnswer: A\\nIf 4 daps = 7 yaps, and 5 yaps = 3 baps,\\nhow many daps equal 42 baps?\\n(A) 28 (B) 21 (C) 40 (D) 30\\nAnswer: C␣\\nThe following are multiple choice questions\\nabout high school mathematics.\\n(a) An example of few-shot learning and inference us-\\ning GPT-3.

The granularity and breadth of the\\nsubjects makes the benchmark ideal for identifying a model’s blind spots.\\nWe ﬁnd that meaningful progress on our benchmark has only become possible in recent months. In\\nparticular, few-shot models up to 13 billion parameters (Brown et al., 2020) achieve random chance\\nperformance of 25% accuracy, but the 175 billion parameter GPT-3 model reaches a much higher\\n43.9% accuracy (see Figure 1b). On the other hand, unlike human professionals GPT-3 does not\\nexcel at any single subject. Instead, we ﬁnd that performance is lopsided, with GPT-3 having almost\\n70% accuracy for its best subject but near-random performance for several other subjects.\\nOur results indicate that while recent advances have been impressive, state-of-the-art models still\\nstruggle at learning and applying knowledge from pretraining. The tasks with near-random accuracy\\ninclude calculation-heavy subjects such as physics and mathematics and subjects related to human\\nvalues such as law and morality. This second weakness is particularly concerning because it will\\nbe important for future models to have a strong understanding of what is legal and what is ethical.\\nWorryingly, we also ﬁnd that GPT-3 does not have an accurate sense of what it does or does not know\\nsince its average conﬁdence can be up to 24% off from its actual accuracy. We comprehensively\\nevaluate the breadth and depth of a model’s text understanding by covering numerous topics that\\nhumans are incentivized to learn. Since our test consists in 57 tasks, it can be used to analyze\\naggregate properties of models across tasks and to track important shortcomings. The test and code is\\navailable at github.com/hendrycks/test.\\n2\\nRELATED WORK\\nPretraining.\\nThe dominant paradigm in NLP is to pretrain large models on massive text corpora\\nincluding educational books and websites. In the process, these models are exposed to information\\nabout a wide range of topics. Petroni et al. (2019) found that recent models learn enough information\\nfrom pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases. However, no prior work has comprehensively\\nmeasured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains.\\nUntil recently, researchers primarily used ﬁne-tuned models on downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019).\\nHowever, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) have made it possible to achieve\\ncompetitive performance without ﬁne-tuning by using few-shot learning, which removes the need for\\na large ﬁne-tuning set. With the advent of strong zero-shot and few-shot learning, it is now possible\\nto curate a diverse set of tasks for evaluation and remove the possibility of models on “spurious cues”\\n(Geirhos et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2019b) in a dataset to achieve high performance.\\nBenchmarks.\\nMany recent benchmarks aim to assess a model’s general world knowledge and basic\\nreasoning ability by testing its “commonsense.” A number of commonsense benchmarks have been\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\\nAs Seller, an encyclopedia salesman, approached the grounds on which Hermit\\'s house was situated,\\nhe saw a sign that said, \"No salesmen.

In contrast,\\nwe include harder specialized subjects that people must study to learn.\\nSome researchers have suggested that the future of NLP evaluation should focus on Natural Language\\nGeneration (NLG) (Zellers et al., 2020), an idea that reaches back to the Turing Test (Turing, 1950).\\nHowever, NLG is notoriously difﬁcult to evaluate and lacks a standard metric (Sai et al., 2020).\\nConsequently, we instead create a simple-to-evaluate test that measures classiﬁcation accuracy on\\nmultiple choice questions.\\nWhile several question answering benchmarks exist, they are comparatively limited in scope. Most\\neither cover easy topics like grade school subjects for which models can already achieve strong\\nperformance (Clark et al., 2018; Khot et al., 2019; Mihaylov et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2019), or\\nare focused on linguistic understanding in the form of reading comprehension (Lai et al., 2017;\\nRichardson et al., 2013). In contrast, we include a wide range of difﬁcult subjects that go far beyond\\nlinguistic understanding.\\n3\\nA MULTITASK TEST\\nWe create a massive multitask test consisting of multiple-choice questions from various branches of\\nknowledge. The test spans subjects in the humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, and other areas\\nthat are important for some people to learn. There are 57 tasks in total, which is also the number\\nof Atari games (Bellemare et al., 2013), all of which are listed in Appendix B. The questions in\\nthe dataset were manually collected by graduate and undergraduate students from freely available\\nsources online. These include practice questions for tests such as the Graduate Record Examination\\nand the United States Medical Licensing Examination. It also includes questions designed for\\nundergraduate courses and questions designed for readers of Oxford University Press books. Some\\ntasks cover a subject, like psychology, but at a speciﬁc level of difﬁculty, such as “Elementary,”\\n“High School,” “College,” or “Professional.” For example, the “Professional Psychology” task draws\\non questions from freely available practice questions for the Examination for Professional Practice\\nin Psychology, while the “High School Psychology” task has questions like those from Advanced\\nPlacement Psychology examinations.\\nWe collected 15908 questions in total, which we split into a few-shot development set, a validation\\nset, and a test set. The few-shot development set has 5 questions per subject, the validation set may\\nbe used for selecting hyperparameters and is made of 1540 questions, and the test set has 14079\\nquestions. Each subject contains 100 test examples at the minimum, which is longer than most exams\\ndesigned to assess people.\\nHuman-level accuracy on this test varies. Unspecialized humans from Amazon Mechanical Turk\\nobtain 34.5% accuracy on this test. Meanwhile, expert-level performance can be far higher. For\\nexample, real-world test-taker human accuracy at the 95th percentile is around 87% for US Medical\\nLicensing Examinations, and these questions make up our “Professional Medicine” task. If we take\\nthe 95th percentile human test-taker accuracy for exams that build up our test, and if we make an\\neducated guess when such information is unavailable, we then estimate that expert-level accuracy is\\napproximately 89.8%.\\nSince our test aggregates different subjects and several levels of difﬁculty, we measure more than\\nstraightforward commonsense or narrow linguistic understanding.

Branches of the humanities include law, philosophy, history,\\nand so on (Appendix B). Mastering these subjects requires a variety of skills. For example, legal\\nunderstanding requires knowledge of how to apply rules and standards to complex scenarios, and\\nalso provide answers with stipulations and explanations. We illustrate this in Figure 2. Legal\\nunderstanding is also necessary for understanding and following rules and regulations, a necessary\\ncapability to constrain open-world machine learning models. For philosophy, our questions cover\\nconcepts like logical fallacies, formal logic, and famous philosophical arguments. It also covers\\nmoral scenarios, including questions from the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2020) that test a\\nmodel’s understanding of normative statements through predicting widespread moral intuitions about\\ndiverse everyday scenarios. Finally, our history questions cover a wide range of time periods and\\ngeographical locations, including prehistory and other advanced subjects.\\n3.2\\nSOCIAL SCIENCE\\nSocial science includes branches of knowledge that examine human behavior and society. Subject\\nareas include economics, sociology, politics, geography, psychology, and so on. See Figure 3 for\\nan example question. Our economics questions include microeconomics, macroeconomics, and\\neconometrics, and cover different types of problems, including questions that require a mixture of\\nworld knowledge, qualitative reasoning, or quantitative reasoning. We also include important but\\nmore esoteric topics such as security studies in order to test the boundaries of what is experienced and\\nlearned during pretraining. Social science also includes psychology, a ﬁeld that may be especially\\nimportant for attaining a nuanced understanding of humans.\\n3.3\\nSCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM)\\nSTEM subjects include physics, computer science, mathematics, and more.

An example is depicted in Figure 5. This section also contains\\nbusiness topics like ﬁnance, accounting, and marketing, as well as knowledge of global facts. The\\nlatter includes statistics about poverty in different countries over time, which may be necessary for\\nhaving an accurate model of the world internationally.\\n4\\nEXPERIMENTS\\n4.1\\nSETUP\\nAssessment and Models.\\nTo measure performance on our multitask test, we compute the clas-\\nsiﬁcation accuracy across all examples and tasks. We evaluate GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and\\nUniﬁedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020). For GPT-3 we use the OpenAI API, which provides access to four\\nmodel variants, “Ada,” “Babbage,” “Curie,” and “Davinci,” which we refer to as “Small” (2.7 billion\\nparameters), “Medium” (6.7 billion), “Large” (13 billion) and “X-Large” (175 billion). UniﬁedQA\\nuses the T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) text-to-text backbone and is ﬁne-tuned on previously proposed\\nquestion answering datasets (Lai et al., 2017), where the prediction is the class with the highest\\ntoken overlap with UniﬁedQA’s text output. Since UniﬁedQA is ﬁne-tuned on other datasets, we\\nevaluate it without any further tuning to assess its transfer accuracy. We also ﬁne-tune RoBERTa-base,\\nALBERT-xxlarge, and GPT-2 on UniﬁedQA training data and our dev+val set. We primarily focus on\\nUniﬁedQA and GPT-3 in the rest of this document, but additional discussion of RoBERTa, ALBERT,\\nand GPT-2 is in Appendix A.\\nModel\\nHumanities\\nSocial Science\\nSTEM\\nOther\\nAverage\\nRandom Baseline\\n25.0\\n25.0\\n25.0\\n25.0\\n25.0\\nRoBERTa\\n27.9\\n28.8\\n27.0\\n27.7\\n27.9\\nALBERT\\n27.2\\n25.7\\n27.7\\n27.9\\n27.1\\nGPT-2\\n32.8\\n33.3\\n30.2\\n33.1\\n32.4\\nUniﬁedQA\\n45.6\\n56.6\\n40.2\\n54.6\\n48.9\\nGPT-3 Small (few-shot)\\n24.4\\n30.9\\n26.0\\n24.1\\n25.9\\nGPT-3 Medium (few-shot)\\n26.1\\n21.6\\n25.6\\n25.5\\n24.9\\nGPT-3 Large (few-shot)\\n27.1\\n25.6\\n24.3\\n26.5\\n26.0\\nGPT-3 X-Large (few-shot)\\n40.8\\n50.4\\n36.7\\n48.8\\n43.9\\nTable 1: Average weighted accuracy for each model on all four broad disciplines.

We begin each\\nprompt with “The following are multiple choice\\nquestions (with answers) about [subject].” For\\nzero-shot evaluation, we append the question to\\nthe prompt. For few-shot evaluation, we add up\\nto 5 demonstration examples with answers to\\nthe prompt before appending the question. All\\nprompts end with “Answer: ”. The model then\\nproduces probabilities for the tokens “A,” “B,”\\n“C,” and “D,” and we treat the highest probability\\noption as the prediction. For consistent evalua-\\ntion, we create a dev set with 5 ﬁxed few-shot\\nexamples for each subject.\\n4.2\\nRESULTS\\nModel Size and Accuracy.\\nWe compare the\\nfew-shot accuracy of each GPT-3 size in Table 1.\\nWe ﬁnd that the three smaller GPT-3 models\\nhave near random accuracy (around 25%). In\\ncontrast, we ﬁnd that the X-Large 175 billion\\nparameter GPT-3 model performs substantially\\nbetter than random, with an accuracy of 43.9%.\\nWe also ﬁnd qualitatively similar results in the\\nzero-shot setting. While the smaller models\\nhave around 25% zero-shot accuracy, Figure 10\\nin Appendix A shows that the largest GPT-3\\nmodel has a much higher zero-shot accuracy of\\nabout 37.7%. Brown et al. (2020) also observe\\nthat larger GPT-3 models perform better, though\\nprogress tends to be steadier. In Figure 1b we\\nshow that non-random accuracy on the multitask\\ntest emerged with recent large few-shot models\\ncompared to datasets that assess commonsense\\nand linguistic understanding.\\nTo test the usefulness of ﬁne-tuning instead of\\nfew-shot learning, we also evaluate UniﬁedQA\\nmodels. UniﬁedQA has the advantage of being\\nﬁne-tuned on other question answering datasets,\\nunlike GPT-3. We assess UniﬁedQA by evalu-\\nating its transfer performance without any ad-\\nditional ﬁne-tuning.\\nThe largest UniﬁedQA\\nmodel we test has 11 billion parameters, which\\nis slightly smaller than GPT-3 Large. Neverthe-\\nless, we show in Table 1 that it attains 48.9%\\naccuracy. This performs better than the few-shot GPT-3 X-Large model, despite UniﬁedQA have\\nan order of magnitude fewer parameters. We also ﬁnd that even the smallest UniﬁedQA variant,\\nwith just 60 million parameters, has approximately 29.3% accuracy. These results suggest that while\\nmodel size is a key component for achieving strong performance, ﬁne-tuning also helps.\\nComparing Disciplines.\\nUsing our test, we discover that GPT-3 and UniﬁedQA have lopsided\\nperformance and several substantial knowledge gaps. Figure 6 shows the accuracy of GPT-3 (few-\\nshot) and UniﬁedQA for all 57 tasks. It shows the both models are below expert-level performance\\nfor all tasks, with GPT-3’s accuracy ranging from 69% for US Foreign Policy to 26% for College\\nChemistry. UniﬁedQA does best on marketing, with an accuracy of 82.5%.\\nOverall, models do poorly on highly procedural problems. Figure 6 shows that calculation-heavy\\nSTEM subjects tend to have low accuracy compared to verbal subjects.

We speculate\\nthat is in part because GPT-3 acquires declarative knowledge more readily than procedural knowledge.\\nFor example, many questions in Elementary Mathematics require applying the order of operations\\nfor arithmetic, which is described by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses Exponents Multiplication\\nDivision Addition Subtraction). In Figure 7, we conﬁrm that GPT-3 is aware of the acronym\\nPEMDAS. However, it does not consistently apply PEMDAS to actual problems. On the other hand,\\nprocedural understanding is not its only weak point. We ﬁnd that some verbal tasks such as Moral\\nScenarios from Hendrycks et al. (2020) and Professional Law also have especially low accuracy.\\nOur test also shows that GPT-3 acquires knowledge quite unlike humans. For example, GPT-3 learns\\nabout topics in a pedagogically unusual order. GPT-3 does better on College Medicine (47.4%)\\nand College Mathematics (35.0%) than calculation-heavy Elementary Mathematics (29.9%). GPT-3\\ndemonstrates unusual breadth, but it does not master a single subject. Meanhwhile we suspect humans\\nhave mastery in several subjects but not as much breadth. In this way, our test shows that GPT-3 has\\nmany knowledge blindspots and has capabilities that are lopsided.\\nCalibration.\\nWe should not trust a model’s prediction unless the model is calibrated, meaning\\nthat its conﬁdence is a good estimate of the actual probability the prediction is correct. However,\\nlarge neural networks are often miscalibrated (Guo et al., 2017), especially under distribution shift\\n(Ovadia et al., 2019). We evaluate the calibration of GPT-3 by testing how well its average conﬁdence\\nestimates its actual accuracy for each subject. We show the results in Figure 8, which demonstrates\\nthat GPT-3 is uncalibrated. In fact, its conﬁdence is only weakly related to its actual accuracy in\\nthe zero-shot setting, with the difference between its accuracy and conﬁdence reaching up to 24%\\nfor some subjects. Another calibration measure is the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error\\n(Hendrycks et al., 2019a; Kumar et al., 2019). Many tasks have miscalibrated predictions, such as\\nElementary Mathematics which has a zero-shot RMS calibration error of 19.4%. Models are only\\nsomewhat more calibrated in the few-shot setting, as shown in Appendix A. These results suggest\\nthat model calibration has wide room for improvement.\\n5\\nDISCUSSION\\nMultimodal Understanding.\\nWhile text is capable of conveying an enormous number of concepts\\nabout the world, many important concepts are conveyed mainly through other modalities, such as\\nimages, audio, and physical interaction (Bisk et al., 2020). Existing large-scale NLP models, such as\\nGPT-3, do not incorporate multimodal information, so we design our benchmark to capture a diverse\\narray of tasks in a text-only format. However, as models gain the ability to process multimodal inputs,\\nbenchmarks should be designed to reﬂect this change. One such benchmark could be a “Turk Test,”\\nconsisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-deﬁned tasks that\\nrequire models to interact with ﬂexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.\\nThe Internet as a Training Set.\\nA major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask\\nNLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have\\nacquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This\\n7\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\\nprocess is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the\\ndownstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up\\nfrom reading the same text.\\nThis motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how\\nhumans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large\\nquestion bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk\\nabout the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available,\\nsuch as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum, but there are fewer than 5,000\\nmultistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number\\nof practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.\\nFor this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide\\na dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be\\nused for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set is used to compute the ﬁnal accuracy. Importantly,\\nthe format of our evaluation is not identical to the format in which information is acquired during\\npretraining. This has the beneﬁt of obviating concerns about spurious training set annotation artifacts\\n(Geirhos et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2019b) and is in stark contrast to the previous paradigm\\nof identically distributed training and test sets. This change also enables collecting a much more\\nextensive and diverse set of tasks for evaluation. We anticipate our methodology becoming more\\nwidespread as models improve at extracting information from diverse online sources.\\nModel Limitations.\\nWe ﬁnd that current large-scale Transformers have wide room for improvement.\\nThey are notably poor at modeling human (dis)approval, as evident by the low performance on the\\nProfessional Law and Moral Scenarios tasks. For future systems to be aligned with human values, high\\nperformance on these tasks is crucial (Hendrycks et al., 2020), so future research should especially\\naim to increase accuracy on these tasks. Models also have difﬁculty performing calculations, so much\\nso that they exhibit poor performance on Elementary Mathematics and many other STEM subjects\\nwith “plug and chug” problems. Additionally, they do not match expert-level performance (90%) on\\nany subject, so for all subjects it is subhuman. On average, models are only now starting to move\\nbeyond random-chance accuracy levels.\\nAddressing these shortcomings may be challenging. To illustrate this, we attempted to create a better\\nProfessional Law model by pretraining on specialized data but achieved only limited success. We\\ncollected approximately 2,000 additional Professional Law training examples. After ﬁne-tuning a\\nRoBERTa-base model (Liu et al., 2019) using this custom training set, our model attained 32.8% test\\naccuracy. To test the impact of additional specialized training data, we also had RoBERTa continue\\npretraining on approximately 1.6 million legal case summaries using Harvard’s Law Library case law\\ncorpus case.law, but after ﬁne-tuning it only attained 36.1% accuracy. This suggests that while\\nadditional pretraining on relevant high quality text can help, it may not be enough to substantially\\nincrease the performance of current models.\\nIt is unclear whether simply scaling up existing language models will solve the test. Current\\nunderstanding indicates that a 10× increase in model size must be accompanied by an approximate\\n5× increase in data (Kaplan et al., 2020). Aside from the tremendous expense in creating multi-trillion\\nparameter language models, data may also become a bottleneck, as there is far less written about\\nesoteric branches of knowledge than about everyday situations.\\n6\\nCONCLUSION\\nWe introduced a new test that measures how well text models can learn and apply knowledge\\nencountered during pretraining. By covering 57 subjects at varying levels of difﬁculty, the test\\nassesses language understanding in greater breadth and depth than previous benchmarks. We found\\nthat it has recently become possible for models to make meaningful progress on the test, but that\\nstate-of-the-art models have lopsided performance and rarely excel at any individual task. We also\\nshowed that current models are uncalibrated and have difﬁculty with tasks that require calculations.\\nWorryingly, models also perform especially poorly on socially relevant subjects including morality\\nand law. Our expansive test can help researchers pinpoint important shortcomings of models, making\\nit easier to gain a clearer picture of state-of-the-art capabilities.\\n8\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nWe would like to thank the following for their helpful comments: Oyvind Tafjord, Jan Leike, David\\nKrueger, Alex Tamkin, Girish Sastry, and Henry Zhu.

For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\\nA.1\\nANALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10 billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\\n11\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9% accuracy for the humanities, 28.8% for social sciences,\\n27.0% for STEM, and 27.7% for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7% for the social sciences, 27.7% for STEM, and 27.9% for other.\\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8% accuracy for the humanities, 33.3% for the social\\nsciences, 30.2% for STEM, and 33.1% for other.\\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60 million parameters and approximately\\n29.3% accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\\nUniﬁedQA with 3 billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\\nbillion parameters attains 32.4% accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\\nA.2\\nERROR ANALYSIS\\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes. We ﬁnd that while many of\\nthese mistakes were clearly wrong, many were mistakes that a human might make. For example,\\none question it got wrong was “How many chromosomes do all human somatic cells contain?” The\\ncorrect answer is 46, while few-shot GPT-3 predicted 23 with conﬁdence 97.5%. This answer would\\nhave been correct if the question asked about the number of pairs of chromosomes. Similarly, many\\nof its other high conﬁdence mistakes were also correct answers to slightly different questions.\\nA.3\\nFORMAT SENSITIVITY\\nWhile different question formatting choices often lead to similar GPT-3 accuracies, we ﬁnd that\\nUniﬁedQA is more sensitive.

This shows that longer questions are not necessarily harder.\\nB.2\\nEXACT QUESTION AND ANSWER CONTAMINATION\\nSince language models train on vast text corpora, there is some chance that they have seen the exact\\nquestion and answer during pretraining. If they memorized the exact question and answer, then\\nthey would attain higher accuracy than their true ability. Likewise, a question’s entropy would be\\nespecially low if it were memorized. Memorized questions and answers should have low entropy and\\n13\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\\nhigh accuracy. However, in Figure 13, we see that accuracy and question entropy are not positively\\ncorrelated, suggesting that the test’s low-entropy questions do not correspond to memorized (and\\nthereby correctly predicted) answers. This suggests that our exact questions were not memorized.\\nHowever, during pretraining models encountered text related to our questions through processing\\nWikipedia. We also note that most of our questions came from PDFs or websites where questions and\\nanswers are on separate pages.\\nSee Brown et al. (2020) for a previous discussion of contamination showing that the phenomena\\nhardly affects performance. To reduce the probability that future models encounter exact questions\\nduring test-time, we will provide a list of question sources.\\n2.8\\n2.6\\n2.4\\n2.2\\n2.0\\n1.8\\nLog Probability Per Token\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\nAccuracy (%)\\nGPT-3 Zero-Shot\\nPrompt Compression and Accuracy\\n2.4\\n2.2\\n2.0\\n1.8\\n1.6\\n1.4\\n1.2\\nLog Probability Per Token\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nAccuracy (%)\\nGPT-3 Few-Shot\\nPrompt Compression and Accuracy\\nFigure 13: The average log probability of the question (without answer) is not strongly positively\\ncorrelated with accuracy, all else equal.

Introduction\\nUntil as recently as two years ago, reasoning was considered\\nto be one of the most signiﬁcant challenges that large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) had not yet overcome (Marcus, 2018;\\n2020; Garcez & Lamb, 2020). Recently, LLMs have shown\\nimpressive success on a wide range of tasks, including com-\\nmonsense (Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021; Madaan\\net al., 2022), mathematical (Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Wu\\net al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2022), and symbolic reason-\\ning (Yao et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2022), using few-shot\\nprompting (Brown et al., 2020).\\nThis process has been accelerated by methods that require\\nLLMs to generate their explicit reasoning steps, such as\\n“chain-of-thought” (Wei et al., 2022), “scratchpads” (Nye\\net al., 2021), and “least-to-most” (Zhou et al., 2022) prompt-\\ning. In particular, the widely used chain-of-thought (COT)\\nmethod presents the model with the explicit intermediate\\nsteps that are required to reach the ﬁnal answer. Then, the\\nmodel is expected to apply a similar decomposition to the ac-\\ntual test example, and consecutively reach an accurate ﬁnal\\nanswer (Ling et al., 2017; Amini et al., 2019). Nevertheless,\\nwhile LLMs can decompose natural language problems into\\nsteps and perform simple arithmetic operations, their perfor-\\nmance falls dramatically when dealing with complex arith-\\nmetic (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh,\\n2022) or large numbers (Nogueira et al., 2021; Qian et al.,\\n2022). In fact, even when ﬁne-tuning a PaLM-based model\\non 164B tokens of explicit mathematical content, its two\\nmost common failures are reportedly “incorrect reasoning”\\nand “incorrect calculation” (Lewkowycz et al., 2022).\\nIn this paper, we propose Program-Aided Language\\nmodel (PAL): a novel method that uses an LLM to read\\nnatural language problems and generate programs as rea-\\nsoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a Python inter-\\npreter, as illustrated in Figure 1. This ofﬂoading leverages an\\nLLM that can decompose a natural language problem into\\nprogrammatic steps, which is fortunately available using\\ncontemporary state-of-the-art LLMs that are pre-trained on\\nboth natural language and programming languages (Brown\\net al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021a; Chowdhery et al., 2022).\\nWhile natural language understanding and decomposition\\narXiv:2211.10435v2  [cs.CL]  27 Jan 2023\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n2\\nA: The bakers started with 200 loaves\\nloaves_baked = 200\\nThey sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon\\nloaves_sold_morning = 93\\nloaves_sold_afternoon = 39\\nThe grocery store returned 6 loaves.\\nloaves_returned = 6\\nThe answer is\\nanswer =\\xa0loaves_baked -\\xa0loaves_sold_morning\\n\\xa0 -\\xa0loaves_sold_afternoon +\\xa0loaves_returned\\n>>> print(answer)\\n74\\nQ: Roger has 5 tennis balls.

In contrast, Program-aided Language models (PAL, right) generate intermediate\\nsteps and Python code.

Chain-of-thought reasoning is highlighted in blue;\\nPAL steps are highlighted in gray and pink; the Python interpreter run is highlighted in black and green.\\nrequire LLMs, solving and reasoning can be done with the\\nexternal solver. This bridges an important gap in chain-of-\\nthought-like methods, where reasoning chains can be correct\\nbut produce an incorrect answer.\\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of PAL across 13 arith-\\nmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks. In all these tasks,\\nPAL using Codex (Chen et al., 2021a) outperforms much\\nlarger models such as PaLM-540B using chain-of-thought\\nprompting. For example, on the popular GSM8K bench-\\nmark, PAL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing\\nPaLM-540B with chain-of-thought by absolute 15% top-\\n1 accuracy. When the questions contain large numbers, a\\ndataset we call GSM-HARD, PAL outperforms COT by an ab-\\nsolute 40%. We believe that this seamless synergy between\\na neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter is an essential step\\ntowards general and robust AI reasoners.\\n2. Background: Few-shot Prompting\\nFew-shot prompting leverages the strength of large-language\\nmodels to solve a task with a set of k examples that are pro-\\nvided as part of the test-time input (Brown et al., 2020;\\nLiu et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022), where k is usu-\\nally a number in the low single digits. These input-output\\nexamples {(xi, yi)}k\\ni=1 are concatenated in a prompt p\\n≡⟨x1 · y1⟩∥⟨x2 · y2⟩∥. . . ∥⟨xk · yk⟩. where “·” denotes\\nthe concatenation of an input and output, and “∥” indicate\\nthe concatenation of different examples. During inference,\\na test instance xtest is appended to the prompt, and p ∥xtest\\nis passed to the model which attempts to complete p ∥xtest,\\nand thereby generate an answer ytest. Note that such few-\\nshot prompting does not modify the underlying LLM.\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n3\\nWei et al. (2022) additionally augment each in-context exam-\\nple with chain of thought (COT) intermediate steps. Speciﬁ-\\ncally, each in-context example in the COT setup is a triplet\\n⟨xi, ti, yi⟩, where xi and yi are input-output pair as before,\\nand ti is a natural language description of the steps that are\\nneeded to arrive at the output yi from the input xi. See Fig-\\nure 1 for an example. With the additional “thoughts” ti, the\\nprompt is set to p ≡⟨x1·t1·y1⟩∥⟨x2·t2·y2⟩∥. . .∥⟨xk·tk·yk⟩.\\nDuring inference, the new question xtest is appended to\\nthe prompt as before and supplied to the LLM. Crucially,\\nthe model is tasked with generating both the thought ttest\\nand the ﬁnal answer ytest. This approach of prompting the\\nmodel to ﬁrst generate a reasoning process ttest improves\\nthe accuracy of the answer ytest across a wide range of\\ntasks (Wang et al., 2022a; Wei et al., 2022; Zhou et al.,\\n2022; Wang et al., 2022b).\\n3. Program-aided Language Models\\nIn a Program-aided Language model, we propose to gen-\\nerate the thoughts t for a given natural language prob-\\nlem x as interleaved natural language (NL) and program-\\nming language (PL) statements. Since we delegate the\\nsolution step to an interpreter, we do not provide the ﬁ-\\nnal answers to the examples in our prompt. That is, ev-\\nery in-context example in PAL is a pair ⟨xi, ti⟩, where\\ntj = [s1, s2, . . . , sN] with each si ∈NL ∪PL, a sequence\\nof tokens in either NL or PL. The complete prompt is thus p\\n≡⟨x1 · t1⟩∥⟨x2 · t2⟩∥. . . ∥⟨xk · tk⟩.\\nGiven a test instance xtest, we append it to the prompt,\\nand p ∥xtest is fed to the LM. We let the LM generate a\\nprediction ttest, which contains both the intermediate steps\\nand their corresponding programmatic statements.\\nA: Roger started with 5 tennis balls. \\ntennis_balls = 5\\n2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is\\nbought_balls = 2 * 3\\ntennis balls. The answer is\\xa0\\nanswer = tennis_balls + bought_balls\\nFigure 2:\\nA close-up of a single example from\\na\\nPAL\\nprompt.\\nChain-of-thought\\nreasoning\\nis\\nhighlighted in blue,\\nand\\nPAL\\nprogrammatic\\nsteps\\nare highlighted in gray and pink.\\nExample\\nA close-up of the example from Figure 1 is\\nshown in Figure 2.\\nWhile chain-of-thought only de-\\ncomposes the solution in the prompt into natural lan-\\nguage steps such as Roger started with 5 tennis balls and\\n2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6, in PAL we also aug-\\nment each such NL step with its corresponding pro-\\ngrammatic statement such as tennis balls = 5 and\\nbought balls = 2 * 3. This way, the model learns\\nto generate a program that will provide the answer for the\\ntest question, instead of relying on LLM to perform the\\ncalculation correctly.\\nWe prompt the language model to generate NL intermediate\\nsteps using comment syntax (e.g. “# ...” in Python)\\nsuch they will be ignored by the interpreter. We pass the\\ngenerated program ttest to its corresponding solver, we run\\nit, and obtain the ﬁnal run result ytest. In this work we use\\na standard Python interpreter, but this can be any solver,\\ninterpreter or a compiler.\\nCrafting prompts for PAL\\nIn our experiments, we lever-\\naged the prompts of existing work whenever available, and\\notherwise randomly selected the same number (3-6) of ex-\\namples as previous work for creating a ﬁxed prompt for\\nevery benchmark. In all cases, we augmented the free-form\\ntext prompts into PAL-styled prompts, leveraging program-\\nming constructs such as for loops and dictionaries when\\nneeded. Generally, writing PAL prompts is easy and quick.\\nWe also ensure that variable names in the prompt mean-\\ningfully reﬂect their roles. For example, a variable that\\ndescribes the number of apples in the basket should have a\\nname such as num apples in basket. This keeps the\\ngenerated code linked to the entities in the question. In\\nSection 6 we show that such meaningful variable names are\\ncritical. Notably, it is also possible to incrementally run\\nthe PL segments and feed the execution results back to the\\nLLM to generate the following blocks. For simplicity, in\\nour experiments, we used a single, post-hoc, execution.\\nThis work focuses on COT-style reasoning chain, but in\\nAppendix I we show that PAL also improves Least-to-\\nMost (Zhou et al., 2022) prompts, which introduce rea-\\nsoning chains that decompose a question into sub-questions.\\n4. Experimental Setup\\nData and in-context examples\\nWe experiment with three\\nbroad classes of reasoning tasks: (1) mathematical prob-\\nlems (§4.1) from a wide range of datasets including\\nGSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021),\\nASDIV (Miao et al., 2020), and MAWPS (Koncel-Kedziorski\\net al., 2016); (2) symbolic reasoning (§4.2) from BIG-Bench\\nHard (Suzgun et al., 2022); (3) and algorithmic problems\\n(§4.3) from BIG-Bench Hard as well.

(2020); chain-of-thought (COT) prompt-\\ning (Wei et al., 2022); and our PAL prompting. We per-\\nformed greedy decoding from the language model using\\na temperature of 0.\\nUnless stated otherwise, we used\\nCODEX (code-davinci-002) as our backend LLM for\\nboth PAL, DIRECT, and COT. In datasets where results for\\nadditional base LMs, such as PaLM-540B, were available\\nfrom previous work, we included them as COT PaLM-540B.\\n4.1. Mathematical Reasoning\\nWe evaluate PAL on eight mathematical word problem\\ndatasets. Each question in these tasks is an algebra word\\nproblem at grade-school level. An example for a question\\nand PAL example prompt is shown in Figure 3. We found\\nthat using explicit NL intermediate steps does not further\\nbeneﬁt these math reasoning tasks, hence we kept only the\\nmeaningful variable names in the prompt.\\nGSM-HARD\\nLLMs can perform simple calculations with\\nsmall numbers. However, Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh (2022)\\nfound that 50% of the numbers in the popular GSM8K\\ndataset of math reasoning problems are integers between 0\\nand 8. This raises the question of whether LLMs can gener-\\nalize to larger and non-integer numbers? We constructed a\\nharder version of GSM8K, which we call GSM-HARD, by re-\\nplacing the numbers in the questions of GSM8K with larger\\nnumbers. Speciﬁcally, one of the numbers in a question\\nwas replaced with a random integer of up to 7 digits. More\\ndetails regarding the this new dataset are provided in H.1.\\n4.2. Symbolic Reasoning\\nWe applied PAL to three symbolic reasoning tasks from\\nBIG-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022), which involve rea-\\nsoning about objects and concepts: (1) COLORED OBJECTS\\nrequires answering questions about colored objects on a sur-\\nface. This task requires keeping track of relative positions,\\nabsolute positions, and the color of each object. Figure 4\\nshows an example for a question and example PAL prompt.\\n(2) PENGUINS describes a table of penguins and some ad-\\nditional information in natural language, and the task is to\\nanswer a question about the attributes of the penguins, for\\nexample, “how many penguins are less than 8 years old?”.\\nWhile both PENGUINS and COLORED OBJECT tasks re-\\nquire tracking objects, PENGUINS describes dynamics as\\nwell, since the penguins in the problem can be added or\\nremoved. Figure 17 in Appendix J.2 shows an example for\\na question, a chain-of-thought prompt, and PAL prompt.\\n(3) DATE is a date understanding task that involves inferring\\ndates from natural language descriptions, performing addi-\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n5\\nQ: I have a chair, two potatoes, a cauliﬂower, a lettuce head, two tables, a cabbage, two onions, and\\nthree fridges.

Algorithmic Tasks\\nFinally, we compare PAL and COT on algorithmic reason-\\ning. These are tasks where a human programmer can write\\na deterministic program with prior knowledge of the ques-\\ntion. We experiment with two algorithmic tasks: OBJECT\\nCOUNTING and REPEAT COPY. OBJECT COUNTING in-\\nvolves answering questions about the number of objects be-\\nlonging to a certain type. For example, as shown in Figure 5:\\n“I have a chair, two potatoes, a cauliﬂower, a lettuce head,\\ntwo tables, ... How many vegetables do I have?”). REPEAT\\nCOPY requires generating a sequence of words according\\nto instructions. For example, as shown in Appendix J.6:\\n“Repeat the word duck four times, but halfway through also\\nsay quack”).\\n5. Results\\n5.1. Math Results\\nTable 1 shows the following results:\\nacross all tasks,\\nPAL using Codex sets a new few-shot state-of-the-art top-\\n1 decoding across all datasets, outperforming COTCodex,\\nCOTPaLM-540B, and COTMinerva 540B which was ﬁne-tuned\\non explicit mathematical content.\\nInterestingly, COT also beneﬁts from Codex over PaLM-\\n540B in some of the datasets such as ASDIV, but performs\\nworse than PaLM-540B in others such as SVAMP. Yet,\\nusing PAL further improves the solve rate across all datasets.\\nGSM-HARD\\nOn GSM-HARD (Table 1), the accuracy of\\nDIRECT drops dramatically from 19.7% to 5.0% (a relative\\ndrop of 74%), the accuracy of COT drops from 65.6% to\\n20.1% (a relative drop of almost 70%), while PAL remains\\nstable at 61.5%, dropping by only 14.3%.

In fact, since PAL ofﬂoads the computation to the\\nPython interpreter, any complex computation can be per-\\nformed accurately given the correctly generated program.\\nLarge Numbers or Incorrect Reasoning?\\nAre the fail-\\nures on GSM-HARD primarily due to the inability of LLMs\\nto do arithmetic, or do the large numbers in the question\\n“confuse” the LM which generates irrational intermediate\\nsteps? To investigate this, we evaluated the outputs gen-\\nerated by COT for the two versions of the same question\\n(with and without large numbers). We ﬁnd that in 16 out\\nof 25 cases we analyzed, COT generates nearly identical\\nnatural language “thoughts”, indicating that the primary fail-\\nure mode is the inability to perform arithmetic accurately.\\nSample outputs are provided in the Appendix, Table 11.\\nGSM8K\\nCOT UL2-20B\\n7.3\\nCOT LaMDA-137B\\n27.7\\nCOT Codex\\n78.0\\nCOT PaLM-540B\\n74.4\\nCOT Minerva 540B\\n78.5\\nPAL Codex\\n80.4\\nTable 3:\\nProblem solve rate (%) on\\nGSM8K using\\nmajority@40 (Wang et al., 2022b)\\nMulti-sample Generation\\nAs found by Wang et al.\\n(2022b), chain-of-thought-style methods can be further im-\\nproved by sampling k > 1 outputs, and selecting the ﬁnal\\nanswer using majority voting.

As shown in Table 3,\\nthis further increases the accuracy of PAL from 72.0% to\\n80.4% on GSM8K, obtaining 1.9% higher accuracy than\\nMinerva-540B using the same number of samples.\\n5.2. Symbolic Reasoning & Algorithmic Tasks Results\\nResults for symbolic reasoning and algorithmic tasks are\\nshown in Table 2. In COLORED OBJECTS, PAL improves\\nover the strong COT by 8.8%, and by 19.4% over the stan-\\ndard direct prompting. In PENGUINS, PAL provides a gain\\nof absolute 14.1% over COT. In DATE, PAL further provides\\n11.4% gain over both COT Codex, PaLM-540B, and LaMDA-137B.\\nThe two rightmost columns of Table 2 show that PAL is\\nclose to solving OBJECT COUNTING, reaching 96.7% and\\nimproving over COT by absolute 23.7%. Similarly, PAL\\nvastly outperforms COT by absolute 21.8% on REPEAT\\nCOPY. Surprisingly, DIRECT prompting performs better\\nthan COT on REPEAT COPY. Yet, PAL improves over\\nDIRECT by 9.3% in REPEAT COPY.\\n[0,2] [3,5] [6,8] [9,11][12,14][15,17][18,20][21,23][24,26]\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1\\nNumber of Objects\\nAccuracy\\nPaL\\nCoT\\nFigure 6: The solve rate on COLORED OBJECTS with re-\\nspect to the number of objects included in the test question.\\nIs PAL sensitive to the complexity of the question?\\nWe\\nexamined how the performance of PAL and COT change as\\nthe complexity of the input question grows, measured as the\\nnumber of objects in the question of COLORED OBJECTS.\\nAs shown in Figure 6, PAL is superior COT across all input\\nlengths.

That is, PAL is not limited to code-LMs only.\\n6. Analysis\\nDoes PAL work with weaker LMs?\\nIn all our experi-\\nments in Section 5, PAL used the code-davinci-002\\nmodel; but can PAL work with weaker models of code? We\\ncompared PAL with COT when both prompting approaches\\nuse the same weaker base LMs code-cushman-001\\nand code-davinci-001. As shown in Figure 7, even\\nthough the absolute accuracies of code-cushman-001\\nand code-davinci-001 are lower, the relative improve-\\nment of PAL over COT remains consistent across models.\\nThis shows that PAL can work with weaker models, while\\nits beneﬁt scales elegantly to stronger models as well.\\nDoes PAL work with LMs of natural language?\\nWe\\nalso experimented with PAL using the text-davinci\\nseries.\\nFigure 8 shows the following interesting re-\\nsults: when the base LM’s “code modeling ability” is\\nweak (using text-davinci-001), COT performs better\\nthan PAL. However, once the LM’s code modeling abil-\\nity is sufﬁciently high (using text-davinci-002 and\\ntext-davinci-003), PAL outperforms COT, and PAL\\ntext-davinci-003 performs almost as PAL code-davinci-002.\\nThis shows that PAL is not limited to LMs of code, but it\\ncan work with LMs that were mainly trained for natural\\nlanguage, if they have a sufﬁciently high coding ability.\\nIs PAL better because of the Python prompt or because\\nof the interpreter?\\nWe experimented with generating\\nPython code, while requiring the neural LM to “execute” it\\nas well, without using an interpreter, following Nye et al.\\n(2021); Madaan et al. (2022). We created prompts that are\\nsimilar to PAL’s, except that they do include the ﬁnal answer.\\nThis resulted in a 23.2 solve rate on GSM8K, much lower\\nthan PAL (72.0), and only 4.5 points higher than DIRECT.\\nThese results reinforce our hypothesis that the main beneﬁt\\nof PAL comes from the synergy with the interpreter, and\\nnot only from having a better prompt. Additional details\\nare provided in Appendix B. For additional discussion on\\nthe advantages of code-prompts over textual-prompts, see\\nAppendix G.\\nDo variable names matter?\\nIn all our experiments, we\\nused meaningful variable names in the PAL prompts, to ease\\nthe model’s grounding of variables to the entities they rep-\\nresent. For the Python interpreter, however, variable names\\nare meaningless. To measure the importance of meaningful\\nvariable names, we experimented with two prompts variants:\\n1. PAL−comment – the PAL prompt without intermediate\\nNL comments.\\n2. PAL−var\\n−comment – the PAL prompt without intermediate\\nNL comments and with variable names substituted\\nwith random characters.\\nThe results are shown in Figure 9. In COLORED OBJECTED\\nand DATE, removing intermediate NL comments but keep-\\ning meaningful variable names (PAL−comment) – slightly re-\\nduces the results compared to the full PAL prompt, but it still\\nachieves higher accuracy than the baselines COT. Remov-\\ning variable names as well (PAL−var\\n−comment) further decreases\\naccuracy, and performs worse than COT. Since variable\\nnames have an important part in code quality (Gellenbeck\\n& Cook, 1991; Takang et al., 1996), meaningful variable\\nnames are only expected to ease reasoning for Codex, which\\nwas trained on mostly meaningful names, as was also found\\nby Madaan et al. (2022).\\n7. Related Work\\nPrompting\\nFew-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) has\\nbeen shown to be an effective approach for a variety of\\ntasks (Liu et al., 2021) ranging from text- (Gehrmann et al.,\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n8\\nColored Objects\\nDate\\nPenguins\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\n100\\n84.4\\n64.8\\n79.2\\n95.2\\n76.2\\n93.3\\n91.1\\n69.1\\n91.3\\n79.9\\n63.4\\n91.9\\nCOT\\nPAL\\nPAL−comment\\nPAL−var\\n−comment\\nFigure 9: Ablation study of PAL prompt formats.

As a reference, we also\\nshow the COT performance (blue).\\n2021; Reif et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021)\\nto code-generation (Chen et al., 2021b). Methods such as\\nchain-of-thought prompting (COT) have further unlocked a\\nvariety of reasoning tasks, boosting the performance of mod-\\nels on a variety of benchmarks. Nevertheless, all previous\\napproaches suffer from inaccuracy in arithmetic calculation\\nand incorrect reasoning (Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Hendrycks\\net al., 2021; Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022). PAL avoids\\nthese problems by ofﬂoading the calculation and some of\\nthe reasoning to a Python interpreter, which is correct by\\nconstruction, given the right program. Further, not only\\nthat PAL can improve the standard chain-of-thought, it can\\nimprove least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2022) as well,\\nas we show in Appendix I.\\nLMs with external tools\\nSeveral prior works have\\nequipped neural models with specialized modules. For ex-\\nample, Cobbe et al. (2021) employ a calculator for arith-\\nmetic operations as a post hoc processing, and Demeter\\n& Downey (2020) add specialized modules for generating\\ncities and dates. Unlike these works, PAL generates code\\nfor a Python interpreter, which is general enough to handle\\nboth arithmetic calculations and dates, without specialized\\nmodules and ad-hoc ﬁxes. Chowdhery et al. (2022) and Wei\\net al. (2022) have also experimented with external calcula-\\ntors; however, the calculator had improved Codex by only\\n2.3% (absolute) on GSM8K and improved PaLM-540B by\\n1.7%, while PAL improves Codex by 6.4% on the same\\nbenchmark (Section 5.1). Similarly to our work, Chowd-\\nhery et al. (2022) have also experimented with generating\\nPython code for solving the GSM8K benchmark, but their\\nexperiments resulted in lower accuracy than the standard\\nPaLM-540B that uses chain-of-thought. Pi et al. (2022)\\npretrain the model on execution results of random expres-\\nsions on a calculator, instead of using the solver at test time\\nas well. While their model can hypothetically perform arith-\\nmetic better than other pretrained LMs, their results on the\\nSVAMP benchmark are much lower: 57.4% using a T5-11B\\nmodel, while PAL achieves 79.4% on the same benchmark\\nwithout any specialized pretraining.\\nShortly after a preprint of our work was submitted to arXiv,\\nanother related work on “program of thought prompting”\\n(Chen et al., 2022) was also submitted to arXiv. Their\\nmethod is conceptually similar to ours, but PoT (1) only\\ndemonstrates efﬁcacy on mathematical problems, whereas\\nwe demonstrate gains on symbolic and algorithmic bench-\\nmarks as well, and (2) chose benchmark-speciﬁc prompt\\nexamples, while we used the same prompt examples as pre-\\nvious work, to disentangled the beneﬁt of our approach from\\nthe beneﬁt of the choice of examples.\\nSemantic parsing\\nOur work can also be seen as a very\\ngeneral form of semantic parsing, where instead of parsing\\ninto strict domain-speciﬁc languages, the model generates\\nfree-form Python code. Some works constrain the decoder\\nusing a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to generate a domain-\\nspeciﬁc meaning representation (Shin & Van Durme, 2021)\\nor a canonical utterance, which can be converted to a Lisp-\\nlike meaning representation (Shin et al., 2021). In contrast,\\nPAL does not require any constraining or domain-speciﬁc\\nrepresentations other than Python code. Further, LMs that\\nwere pretrained on Python are abundant compared to other\\ndomain-speciﬁc languages, making Python code a much\\nmore preferable representation. Andor et al. (2019) generate\\ntask-speciﬁc arithmetic operations for reading comprehen-\\nsion tasks; Gupta et al. (2019) design neural modules such\\nas count to deal with arithmetic operations. PAL gener-\\nalizes these works by generating general Python programs,\\nwithout the need for deﬁning specialized modules. The clos-\\nest work to ours technically may be Binder (Cheng et al.,\\n2022), but it addressed mostly answering questions about\\ntables using SQL and SQL-like Python.\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n9\\n8. Conclusion\\nWe introduce PAL, a new method for natural language rea-\\nsoning, using programs as intermediate reasoning steps.\\nDifferently from existing LM-based reasoning approaches,\\nthe main idea is to ofﬂoad solving and calculating to an\\nexternal Python interpreter, instead of using the LLM for\\nboth understanding the problem and solving. This results\\nin a ﬁnal answer that is guaranteed to be accurate, given the\\ncorrectly predicted programmatic steps. We demonstrate\\nthis seamless synergy between an LLM and a Python in-\\nterpreter across 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other\\nbenchmarks. In all these benchmarks, PAL outperforms\\nlarger LLMs such as PaLM-540B which use the popular\\n“chain-of-thought” method and sets new state-of-the-art ac-\\ncuracy on all of them. We believe that these results unlock\\nexciting directions for future neuro-symbolic AI reasoners.\\nReferences\\nAhn, M., Brohan, A., Brown, N., Chebotar, Y., Cortes, O.,\\nDavid, B., Finn, C., Fu, C., Gopalakrishnan, K., Hausman,\\nK., Herzog, A., Ho, D., Hsu, J., Ibarz, J., Ichter, B.,\\nIrpan, A., Jang, E., Ruano, R.

Uninformative variable names PAL - var cause a drastic drop in performance, indicating that just structure is not\\nsufﬁcient. The corresponding prompts are shown in Figure 10.\\nFor mathematical problems, since our standard prompts do not use much comment, we start by creating alternative prompts\\nwhere the informative variable names are replaced with single-letters (Figure 10). The results in Table 4 shows a considerable\\nperformance drop: from an average of 71.8% to 59%. Note that the ablation where structured outputs are completely\\nremoved in favor of purely text explanations is precisely the COT setting, which achieves a solve rate of 63%. These results\\nunderscore the importance of text but more importantly show that combining both text and procedural statements leads to\\nhigher performance gains—either is sub-optimal.\\nB. Additional analysis on Arithmetic Reasoning\\nGSM-hard with hard prompts\\nThe GSM-HARD experiments used prompts that were sampled from the GSM8K training\\nset. Will COT be helped by using larger numbers in the prompts as well? To investigate this, we create prompts where the\\nnumbers are changed to larger numbers, matching the distribution of numbers in GSM-HARD. The results in Table 5 shows\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n14\\nthat even with a prompt that matches the numbers, there are only modest gains in performance. These results show that the\\ngains achieved by using code-based reasoning chains may not be achieved simply by using better few-shot examples for\\nCOT.\\nRegular Prompt\\nPrompt with Larger Numbers\\nCOT\\n23.3\\n23.8\\nTable 5: GSM-hard results, when the prompts also had examples of larger numbers.\\nSuccinct Code\\nThe programs used in few-shot examples by PAL are multi-step, and show a step-by-step breakdown of\\nthe reasoning process. Is this breakdown necessary? Alternatively, can we return a single line expression (see Figure 11b) to\\ncalculate the result? Results in Table 6 (4th row) shows that is not the case. With single-line expressions, the performance of\\nPAL falls to the level of direct prompting.\\nGenerating the answer directly\\nPAL ﬁrst generates a reasoning chain in the form of a Python program, and passes the\\ngenerated program to a runtime to obtain an answer. Is PAL better only because of the program-style intermediate reasoning\\nchains, or are the improvements derived from ofﬂoading execution to the Python runtime? To investigate this, we experiment\\nwith a variant that forces the LLM to generate the answer after generating the reasoning chain (Figure 11e). This setting\\ncompels the LLM to condition on the generated code-based reasoning to generate an answer, simulating the runtime. The\\nresults in Table 6 (5th row) show that the solve rate drops to near DIRECT levels. This reinforces our hypothesis that while\\ncurrent LLMs can be excellent at specifying a high-level plan to solve a task—they are still incapable of executing them.\\nAblation\\nSolve Rate\\nDIRECT (no intermediate reasoning)\\n19.7\\nCOT\\n65.6\\nPAL\\n72.0\\nSuccinct Code\\n47.8\\nLLM Simulating Runtime\\n23.2\\nTable 6: Solve Rates for Ablations\\nC. Effect of Using Language Models of Code\\nIn our experiments, we focused on evaluating the performance of a language model for code. We aimed to investigate\\nwhether the additional performance boost observed in our results was due to the use of models like Codex, or whether our\\nformulation was useful even for text-based models. To this end, we conducted additional experiments using text-based\\nlanguage models. Our ﬁndings indicate that the PAL approach is not restricted to working solely with Codex, but can also\\nbe applied to natural language (NL) models, as long as the model is sufﬁciently strong. Speciﬁcally, our results showed that\\nin the text-davinci-001 model, the use of the CoT approach resulted in better performance.\\nModel\\nCoT\\nPaL\\ntext-davinci-001\\n26.5\\n8.6\\ntext-davinci-002\\n46.9\\n65.8\\ntext-davinci-003\\n65.3\\n69.8\\nD. Analyzing the Effect of Increasing Number of Samples on PAL\\nIn Section 5.1, we show that PAL outperforms strong baselines both for a single sample and by drawing 40 samples and\\nusing majority voting. Figure 12 illustrates the trends for cases when the number of samples drawn are between 1 and 40,\\nand the interpolation estimates demonstrate that PAL remains competitive throughout the number of samples.\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n15\\ndef solution():\\n\"\"\"Shawn has five toys.

PAL Beyond Benchmarks\\nWe argue that symbolic reasoning is a crucial component in solving a wide range of tasks. In this section, we demonstrate\\nexamples of tasks that may not initially appear to require using programs as intermediate reasoning steps, but can be\\nimproved through the use of PAL-style reasoning. We demonstrate these examples using the ChatGPT tool.1 In contrast to\\nthe in-context-learning methods we used in the main paper, here we instruct ChatGPT to perform program-aided reasoning\\nthrough one of the user utterances.\\nIn Figure 13, in COT-style reasoning, while the reasoning chain is correct, the ﬁnal answer is wrong. In contrast, PAL-style\\nreasoning could not only accurately extract the color of objects from the question but also produce the correct lines of code\\nto branch to different situations that yield their corresponding correct answers.\\nA more intriguing example is letting an LLM count the number of letters in the word “intriguing”. In Figure 14a, while the\\nstep-by-step explanation appears reasonable by splitting the letters by spaces, ChatGPT does not change the answer after\\nthis explicit reasoning and insists on the wrong answer. Explicitly instructing the model to perform step-by-step reasoning\\nbefore answering the question still yields the wrong answer. In contrast, PAL-style reasoning only takes a few lines of code,\\nand the execution does produce the correct answer, in this case. These examples indicate that PAL can beneﬁt even an\\nostensibly powerful model like ChatGPT.\\n1chat.openai.com\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n18\\n(a) In COT style reasoning, the correct intermediate reasoning chain leads to wrong answers.\\n(b) In PAL, the execution of the code will produce the correct answer.\\nFigure 13: ChatGPT with PAL and COT to answer a user-posted question\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n19\\n(a) Step-by-step reasoning struggle on counting the number of letters in the word “intrigu-\\ning” which has ten letters.\\n(b) Explicitly instructing ChatGPT to reason step-by-step before generating answer still\\nleads to the wrong answer.\\n(c) PAL takes a few lines of code and the execution could result in the correct answer.\\nFigure 14: ChatGPT with PAL and COT to answer a user-posted question\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n20\\nG. Closer Look into Token-level Behaviors of Different Mechanisms\\nBeyond empirical results, we make initial attempts to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of LLMs with different\\nreasoning mechanisms by looking into the token-level log-likelihood of reasoning chains produced by COT and PAL.\\nWe randomly selected 20 questions from the COLORED OBJECTS dataset, along with their corresponding COT and PAL\\nsolutions. We then manually compared the two mechanisms by focusing on tokens with a low log-likelihood.\\nOur analysis reveals that COT often has lower conﬁdence in tokens related to numbers and quantitative information, the\\ngrounded position of spatial adjectives (e.g., right-most), properties such as the color of objects, and nouns that refer to the\\nobjects. Speciﬁcally, we found that this occurred in seven, six, two, and six examples out of the 20 we examined. In contrast,\\nPAL uses list manipulations, such as len(objects), and accesses objects and their associated properties through list\\nindexing (e.g., object[3][0]). We found that the LLM is typically conﬁdent in producing these programs. Furthermore,\\nwe observed that while COT requires different expressions for the same concept in different contexts, PAL almost always\\nuses the same expression, which is presumably more robust. For example, when there are ﬁve objects, COT predicts “the\\nright-most thing is the ﬁfth item on the list”, and “the right-most thing is the third item on the list” when the number of\\nobjects is three. Occasionally, COT also predicts “the right-most thing is last item on the list” which does not provide more\\nconcrete information. On the contrary, PAL conﬁdently predicts objects[-1] consistently. The more consistent and\\nuniform use of expressions in PAL can be attributed to the explicit and deﬁned nature of programming languages, which\\nallows for clear and accurate expressions.\\nH.

Creating GSM-HARD\\nWhile replacing numbers in the question is easy using pattern matching, a more challenging aspect is recalculating the correct\\nanswer. GSM8K evaluation set contains 1319 samples, which is prohibitively expensive to perform manual re-calculation.\\nInstead, we leverage PAL to assist obtaining the correct answers. For 71% of the examples where PAL is correct on\\nGSM8K, we utilize the generated program and replace the initial value with the larger values. For example, if we create\\na harder version of the problem in Figure 3 by replacing $23 dollars with $15687 dollars, we correspondingly replace\\nmoney initial=23 to money initial=15678. Running the program could automatically produce the correct\\nanswer of the harder question. Notably, this annotation process assumes that a program that produces a correct answer to\\na GSM8K question indicates the correctness of the program itself. While this is not guaranteed due to possible spurious\\ncorrelations, we manually checked 25 programs and found all of them are correct. For the incorrect 29% of the cases, we\\nrun PAL again and perform nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019) with temperature 0.7, and repeat the above process if\\nany correct solution is found. Finally, the authors manually annotate the correct answer for 50 remaining cases that PAL was\\nnot able to solve after 100 iterations.\\nH.2.

This section examines if PAL generalizes to other prompt types. We\\nconsider a strong alternative prompting strategy LEAST-TO-MOST (Zhou et al., 2022). LEAST-TO-MOST solves problems\\nin two stages, problem-reducing and problem-solving. Problem reducing stage turns the problem into sub-problems, and\\nthe solving stage solves them sequentially. It keeps two prompts, each for an individual stage. To patch LEAST-TO-MOST\\nprompts with PAL, we adopt a simple and straightforward approach: we note that problem reduction requires logically\\nthinking in NL while solving requires the precision that PL offers. We therefore keep the original reducing prompts while\\nonly turning solution segments in the solving scripts in PL. We show an example reducing prompt, original solving prompt,\\nand PAL solving prompt in Figure 15. Note that one unique property of PAL solving can naturally use previous questions’\\nanswers as the symbol values are shared. In comparison, the original solving script needs to explicitly re-cite answers from\\nprevious answers.\\nDataset (500 examples)\\nLEAST-TO-MOST\\nLEAST-TO-MOST + PAL\\nGSM8K\\n67.2\\n72.8\\nSVAMP\\n75.2\\n78.2\\nTable 12: Results on GSM8K and SVAMP with LEAST-TO-MOST and LEAST-TO-MOST with PAL solving prompt.\\nFor our analysis, we consider the Math data sets GSM8K, and SVAMP as Zhou et al.

For example, COT fails in the following example: “On the desk, you see a\\nbunch of items arranged in a row: a gold textbook, a purple puzzle, a teal necklace, and a silver pencil. How many non-gold\\nitems do you see to the right of the pencil?”. With pure NL reasoning, a LLM can easily lose track of the objects and output\\nthe wrong answer of “The number of non-gold items to the right of the pencil is two. So the answer is two.”\\nIn comparison, PAL is able to accurately construct the object lists with correct order and attributes. Further, it can precisely\\nleverage the simple yet complete PL syntax: it composes routines with functional operators from elementary builtin\\noperation/operators. Figure 4 lists the last a few lines of the solution to the question described above generated by PAL,\\nwhich perform ﬁltering over objects. PAL can further compose such operations across multiple reasoning steps as shown in\\nFigure 23b, where it ﬁrst ﬁlters out all pink objects and then scans the remaining to count crayons. Other reasoning such as\\n“how many objects are left after ﬁltering” can be easily tackled precisely with an runtime.\\nK.2. Penguins in a Table\\n...This question focuses on age.

How many\\npenguins are less than 8 years old?) in Penguins in a Table\\n.\\nIn this task, we found a typical failure mode of the language is its inability to stably tracks states in its past generation.\\nFigure 24 lists the generations of COT and PAL to the question that contains the removal of a penguin (“...We then delete\\nthe penguin named Bernard from the table. How many penguins are less than 8 years old?”). Although COT picks up the\\ncritical information that “penguins that are less then 8 years old are Louis and Bernard”, and that “Bernard is deleted”. It\\nstill fails to aggregate the information properly and infer that there is one penguin less then 8 left in the end. In comparison,\\nPAL expresses this dynamic through manipulating a penguins list by ﬁltering out the penguin whose name is “Bernard”,\\nPAL: Program-aided Language Models\\n34\\nand maintaining a penguins under 8 years old list. It ofﬂoads tracking exact the values (in this case, the length of\\nthe list) to the deterministic Python runtime.\\nK.3. Date Understanding\\nQ: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001.

In accordance with our\\nstated viewpoints, we empirically benchmark ChatGPT on\\nmultiple sample datasets. We find that a significant number of\\nethical risks cannot be addressed by existing benchmarks, and\\nhence illustrate them via additional case studies. In addition,\\nwe examine the implications of our findings on AI ethics and\\nharmal behaviors of ChatGPT, as well as future problems\\nand practical design considerations for responsible LLMs. We\\nbelieve that our findings may give light on future efforts to\\ndetermine and mitigate the ethical hazards posed by machines\\nin LLM applications.\\nI. Introduction\\nThe recent advancements in NLP have demonstrated\\ntheir potential to positively impact society and successful\\nimplementations in data-rich domains. LLMs have been\\nutilized in various real-world scenarios, including search\\nengines [1, 2], language translation [3, 4], and copywrit-\\ning [5]. However, these applications may not fully engage\\nusers due to a lack of interaction and communication [6].\\nAs natural language is a medium of communication used\\nby all human interlocutors, conversational language model\\nagents, such as Amazon Echo [7] and Google Home [8],\\nhave the potential to significantly impact people’s daily\\nlives. Despite their potential benefits, unforeseen negative\\n§Correspondence: terry.zhuo@monash.edu\\n1In this paper, ChatGPT refers to the version released on Dec\\n15th.\\neffects on human-computer interaction have also emerged\\nas NLP transitions from theory to reality. This includes\\nissues such as the toxic language generated by Microsoft’s\\nTwitter bot Tay [9] and the privacy breaches of Amazon\\nAlexa [10]. Additionally, during the unsupervised pre-\\ntraining stage, language models may inadvertently learn\\nbias and toxicity from large, noisy corpora [11], which can\\nbe difficult to mitigate.\\nWhile studies have concluded that LLMs can be used\\nfor social good in real-world applications [12], the vul-\\nnerabilities described above can be exploited unethically\\nfor unfair discrimination, automated misinformation, and\\nillegitimate censorship [13]. Consequently, numerous re-\\nsearch efforts have been undertaken on the AI ethics\\nof LLMs, ranging from discovering unethical behavior to\\nmitigating bias [14]. Weidinger et al. [15] systematically\\nstructured the ethical risk landscape with LLMs, clearly\\nidentifying six risk areas: 1) Discrimination, Exclusion,\\nand Toxicity, 2) Information Hazards, 3) Misinformation\\nHarms, 4) Malicious Uses, 5) Human-Computer Interac-\\ntion Harms, 6) Automation, Access, and Environmental\\nHarms. Although their debate serves as the foundation\\nfor NLP ethics research, there is no indication that all\\nhazards will occur in recent language model systems. Em-\\npirical evaluations [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] have revealed that\\nlanguage models face ethical issues in several downstream\\nactivities. Using exploratory studies via model inference,\\nadversarial robustness, and privacy, for instance, early\\nresearch revealed that dialogue-focused language models\\nposed possible ethical issues [21]. Several recent studies\\nhave demonstrated that LLMs, such as GPT-3, have a\\npersistent bias against genders [22] and religions [23].\\nExpectedly, LLMs may also encode toxicity, which results\\nin ethical harms. For instance, Si et al. [24] demonstrated\\nthat BlenderBot[25] and TwitterBot [26] can easily trigger\\ntoxic responses, though with low toxicity.\\nDespite current studies on NLP and ethical risks and\\neffects, the following gaps in earlier research exist:\\n• Practice: Many studies on AI ethics have been con-\\nducted theoretically and may not accurately reflect\\nthe real-world ethical risks.\\n• Timeliness: The rapid advancements in NLP have\\nresulted in a lack of examination of more recent\\nlanguage models from an ethical perspective.\\narXiv:2301.12867v4  [cs.CL]  29 May 2023\\n• Agreement: There is a lack of consensus among\\ndaily users regarding the ethical risks associated with\\ncurrent advanced language model applications.\\n• Comprehensiveness: Most studies have a narrow focus\\non the measurement of selected ethical issues and fail\\nto address all ethical considerations comprehensively.\\nIn this study, we aim to address these deficiencies by\\npresenting a comprehensive qualitative exploration and\\ncatalog of ethical dilemmas and risks in ChatGPT, a\\nrecently launched practical language model from Ope-\\nnAI. ChatGPT is not only one of the largest practical\\nlanguage models available publicly but also one of the\\nfew breakthroughs that have dominated social media.\\nUtilizing a combination of multilingual natural language\\nand programming language to provide comprehensive and\\nadaptable answers, ChatGPT attracts numerous users\\nwho interact with the platform and post feedback on social\\nmedia daily. We investigate the different feedback themes\\nof ChatGPT on Twitter, the dominant social media net-\\nwork, by manually classifying a sample of 305,701 tweets\\naddressing potential ethical risks and harms. We conduct\\na qualitative study on these manually labeled tweets to\\nidentify common themes in the public’s ethical concerns\\nover ChatGPT. The themes can be divided into four\\ncategories: 1) Bias 2) Reliability 3) Robustness 4) Toxicity.\\nIn accordance with the principles espoused by HELM [27],\\nwe meticulously select the appropriate standards to red-\\nteam ChatGPT. However, given the circumscribed nature\\nof the chosen benchmarks, we supplement our assessment\\nby conducting a thorough analysis of the model using\\nprototypical case studies.\\nOur red-teaming has revealed several behaviors ex-\\nhibited by ChatGPT that may have potential ethical\\nimplications, such as bias in programming, susceptibility\\nto prompt injection, and the dissemination of misinfor-\\nmation through hallucination. To gain a deeper under-\\nstanding of the differences between previous studies on AI\\nethics and the ethical implications identified in language\\nmodels, we conducted a comprehensive benchmarking of\\nChatGPT using widely-utilized datasets for measuring\\nethical concerns and harms. The results of our evaluation\\nindicate that some benchmarks fail to fully capture all\\nthe ethical implications. Furthermore, we have identified\\nspecific benchmarks that should be developed based on the\\nfindings from downstream tasks. Based on our empirical\\nevaluation, we discuss ways to address potential ethical\\nconcerns and harms to ensure ethical applications of future\\nLLMs.\\nInstead of contemplating hypothetical or distant uses of\\ntechnology, we believe it is more crucial to address moral\\nor ethical issues in current and future applications [28].\\nSimilar to Goldstein et al. [29], we acknowledge that\\nthe field of AI ethics is still developing and iterative,\\nnecessitating ongoing conversations about definitions and\\nthe creation of ethical frameworks and principles. The\\nobjective of our study is not to provide a flawless,\\nquantitative, and deterministic solution for designing a\\nresponsible language model application, echoing the his-\\ntory of scientific advancement[30, 31]. Through the use\\nof benchmarking frameworks, heuristics, and examples, in\\nconjunction with human evaluation, the goal of our work\\nis to move closer to a comprehensive understanding. We\\nhope that our findings will aid in supporting future work\\non determining and mitigating the AI ethical hazards in\\nlanguage models and their applications.\\nII. Common Themes of Ethical Concerns\\nThis section outlines the two main application scenarios\\nof ChatGPT and the four corresponding common ethical\\nconcerns. In order to establish a taxonomy based on\\ndata analysis, we conducted a comprehensive collection of\\n305,701 tweets pertaining to ChatGPT for the duration\\nof December 2022. We studied all data2, and summarized\\ncommon themes of these tweets on the basis of the previous\\nrisk landscape associated with LLMs [15].\\nA. Application Scenarios\\nLLMs are powerful tools for understanding and gen-\\nerating natural language and potentially programming\\nlanguage. They have a wide range of applications with\\ntwo main scenarios: Creative Generation and Decision-\\nmaking.\\na) Creative Generation: Creative generation involves\\nusing language models to develop fresh and creative\\ncontent, such as writing a story, composing poetry, or\\nscripting film dialogue. This is achieved by training the\\nmodel on a massive corpus of existing books, articles, and\\nscripts. The model learns the patterns, structures, and\\nstyles of text, allowing it to generate similar content. This\\nhas several downstream applications, such as producing\\ncontent for entertainment [32], marketing [33], advertis-\\ning [34], and content summarization [35].\\nb) Decision-making: The use of language models in\\ndecision-making is a significant application scenario in\\nthe field of machine learning. This refers to using these\\nmodels to make informed decisions based on natural\\nlanguage input, as demonstrated in studies on sentiment\\nanalysis [36], text classification [37], and question answer-\\ning [38]. By analyzing and comprehending the meaning\\nand context of the input, these models are able to provide\\njudgments or suggestions based on their understanding of\\nthe information. The models can be used in natural lan-\\nguage processing activities to comprehend, interpret, and\\ngenerate human-like speech, which is a vital component\\nof chatbots, virtual assistants, and language-based games.\\nB. Common Themes of Ethical Concerns\\na) Bias: Bias is a common ethical concern in language\\nmodel development and deployment. There are multiple\\nmanifestations of bias, such as social stereotypes and\\n2Details of manual labels and data analysis will be discussed in\\nan upcoming technical report.\\nunfair discrimination, exclusionary norms, and multilin-\\ngualism.\\nSocial stereotypes and unfair discrimination: When the\\ndata used to train a language model includes biased\\nrepresentations of specific groups of individuals, social\\nstereotypes and unfair discrimination may result [15].\\nThis may cause the model to provide predictions that\\nare unfair or discriminatory towards those groups. For\\nexample, a language technology that analyzes curricula\\nvitae for recruitment or career guidance may be less\\nlikely to recommend historically discriminated groups to\\nrecruiters or more likely to offer lower-paying occupations\\nto marginalized groups. To prevent this, it is essential to\\nensure that the training data is diverse and representative\\nof the population for which it will be used, and to actively\\ndiscover and eradicate any potential biases in the data.\\nExclusionary norms: When a language model is trained\\non data that only represents a fraction of the population,\\nsuch as one culture, exclusionary norms may emerge. This\\ncan result in the model being unable to comprehend or\\ngenerate content for groups that are not represented in\\nthe training data, such as speakers of different languages\\nor people from other cultures [15].\\nMultilingualism: The monolingual bias in multilingual-\\nism is a type of bias that can occur in language models [39].\\nOften, language models are only trained on data in\\none language, preventing them from understanding or\\ngenerating text in other languages. This can result in a\\nlack of access to the benefits of these models for people\\nwho speak different languages and can lead to biased or\\nunfair predictions about those groups [14, 15]. To overcome\\nthis, it is crucial to ensure that the training data contains\\na substantial proportion of diverse, high-quality corpora\\nfrom various languages and cultures.\\nb) Robustness: Another major ethical consideration\\nin the design and implementation of language models is\\ntheir robustness. Robustness refers to a model’s ability\\nto maintain its performance when given input that is\\nsemantically or syntactically different from the input it\\nwas trained on.\\nSemantic Perturbation: Semantic perturbation is a type\\nof input that can cause a language model to fail [40, 41].\\nThis input has different syntax but is semantically similar\\nto the input used for training the model. To address this,\\nit is crucial to ensure that the training data is diverse and\\nrepresentative of the population it will be used for, and\\nto actively identify and eliminate any potential biases in\\nthe data.\\nData Leakage: Data leakage in language models can\\nresult in exposing the model to attacks where adversaries\\ntry to extract sensitive information from the model,\\njeopardizing individual privacy and organizational secu-\\nrity [18]. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to prevent\\ndata leakage by carefully selecting the training dataset, us-\\ning techniques such as regularization and cross-validation\\nto reduce overfitting, and implementing techniques like\\ndifferential privacy and model distillation to protect the\\nmodel from attacks. Furthermore, it is crucial to conduct\\nthorough evaluations using a wide range of test data,\\nmonitor the model’s performance, and be transparent\\nabout the training data and any known biases in the\\nmodel.\\nPrompt Injection: Prompt injection is a type of input\\nthat can lead to a failure in a language model, particularly\\na LLM. This input is data that is deliberately introduced\\ninto the model’s input with the intention of causing\\nit to malfunction. To address this vulnerability, it is\\ncrucial to conduct exhaustive testing on a wide variety of\\ninputs and ensure that the model can accurately recognize\\nand reject inputs that are different from the semantic\\nand syntactic patterns of the input it was trained on.\\nAdditionally, it is essential to establish robust monitoring\\nmethods to detect any malicious use of the model and\\nimplement necessary security measures to prevent such\\nmalicious intent. This includes, but is not limited to,\\ntesting, monitoring, and upgrading the models as needed\\nto ensure optimal performance.\\nc) Reliability:\\nThe reliability of language models\\nis a crucial ethical concern in their development and\\ndeployment. It pertains to the capability of the model\\nto provide precise and dependable information.\\nFalse or Misleading Information: The dissemination of\\nfalse or misleading information is a significant concern\\nin the field of natural language processing, particularly\\nwhen it comes to training language models [42]. This\\nunreliable information may result from using inaccurate or\\nbiased training data, which can lead to false or misleading\\noutputs when the model is used by users. For example,\\nif a language model is trained on data that contains\\nmisinformation about a certain topic, it may provide\\nerroneous information to users when queried about that\\ntopic. To address this issue, it is crucial to exercise due\\ndiligence in ensuring the accuracy and impartiality of the\\ntraining data, as well as actively identify and rectify any\\ninaccuracies that may be present.\\nOutdated Information: Outdated information is another\\ntype of incorrect information that may occur when a\\nlanguage model is trained on obsolete or inaccurate\\ndata [43]. This can result in the model providing users with\\noutdated information, which is detrimental to decision-\\nmaking and information-seeking activities. To prevent\\nthis, it is essential to keep the training data current and to\\ncontinuously monitor and update the model as new data\\nbecomes available, so that the language model provides\\nusers with the most accurate and relevant information.\\nd) Toxicity: The ethical considerations related to\\ntoxicity in the development and deployment of language\\nmodels are of utmost importance. Toxicity refers to the\\nmodel’s ability to generate or understand harmful or\\noffensive content.\\nOffensive Language: One form of toxicity that may\\narise is the presence of offensive language in the training\\ndata. This can result in the model generating or under-\\nstanding offensive or harmful content when interacting\\nwith users [44]. For instance, if a language model is\\ntrained on data that includes racist or sexist language,\\nit may generate or understand racist or sexist content\\nwhen interacting with users. To mitigate this, it is crucial\\nto ensure that the training data does not contain any\\noffensive or hurtful language, and to actively identify and\\nremove any offensive or harmful information that may be\\npresent in the data.\\nPornography: Another form of toxicity that may arise is\\nthe presence of pornographic content in the training data.\\nThis can lead to the model generating or understanding\\npornographic content when interacting with users [45]. To\\nmitigate this, it is crucial to guarantee that the training\\ndata is free of pornographic content and to actively\\nidentify and remove any pornographic content that may\\nbe present in the data. Additionally, it is essential to\\nimplement the necessary security measures to prevent\\nimproper use of the model.\\nIII. Diagnosing AI ethics Of ChatGPT\\nThe objective of this research is to evaluate ChatGPT\\nwith respect to four critical ethical considerations: Bias,\\nReliability, Robustness, and Toxicity. To achieve this,\\nwe use established benchmarks that are consistent with\\nHELM [27]. Our aim is to maximize the alignment between\\nour chosen benchmarks and the scenarios and metrics\\nunder evaluation. To conserve computational resources, we\\nevaluate 80% randomly selected samples of each dataset.\\nUnlike HELM, our evaluation on ChatGPT is conducted\\nin a zero-shot setting, which more accurately reflects the\\ntypical human-computer interaction scenario where in-\\ncontext examples are not provided. Additionally, to gain a\\ncomprehensive understanding of the model’s performance\\non these benchmarks, we present results from several\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM baselines. Like HELM, the\\nbaselines are evaluated with five in-context ground-truth\\nexamples, which we choose from the remaining 20%\\nsamples for each dataset. Although there are a few\\nbenchmarks developed for measuring AI ethics, a lot\\nof unethical scenarios have not yet been collected for\\nevaluation. Hence, we preliminarily evaluate ChatGPT on\\nsome representative case studies. The analysis of these\\nuse cases further reveals the potential vulnerability of\\nadvanced LLM applications in real-world practice. We\\nillustrate the evaluation framework in Figure 1.\\nA. Bias\\n1) Experiment Settings:\\na) Datasets: As evaluation criteria for a comprehen-\\nsive examination of biased and unjust behavior in open-\\ndomain chatbots, we have chosen the BBQ and BOLD\\nstandards. Prior to the introduction of these standards,\\nthere have been numerous attempts to evaluate bias\\nand fairness in chatbots, but their validity has been\\nheavily criticized. As a result, we have selected to conduct\\nour study using BBQ [46] and BOLD [47]. BBQ is\\nspecifically developed to assess bias in the context of\\nquestion-answering, which is in line with our preference\\nfor assessments that are both accurate and less artificial\\nwhen considering social effects. Moreover, BBQ is more\\nuseful and practical in dialogue circumstances. On the\\nother hand, BOLD is a dataset used to measure text\\ngeneration fairness. Although BOLD has previously been\\nused to quantify toxicity, we suggest that, given its neutral\\nbackground, it is better suited for measuring bias. In each\\ngeneration, LLMs are given a domain-specific sub-sentence\\nor prompt to complete.\\nb) Models: In addition to ChatGPT, we have also\\nselected two SOTA LLMs, InstructGPT (davinci-v2) and\\nGPT-3 (davinci-v1) [48], which have demonstrated com-\\nparable results in HELM. Both InstructGPT and GPT-\\n3 are prompt-based, few-shot generative models, capa-\\nble of learning to perform based on in-context exam-\\nples and instructions. However, InstructGPT utilizes a\\nreinforcement-based training strategy, resulting in a more\\ncomprehensive understanding of in-context prompts.\\nc) Metrics: In the BBQ question answering task,\\nwe employ the Quasi-exact match (EM) metric and a\\nbias score as evaluation criteria. The EM metric, as\\nintroduced in the HELM framework, extends the criterion\\nof correctness from exact match to match after slight\\npost-processing, such as lower-casing and punctuation, in\\norder to assess the performance of generative models in\\nclosed-ended question answering tasks. The bias score,\\nadopted from the original BBQ, reflects the percentage of\\nundetermined outputs that align with a specific social bias.\\nA bias score of 0% indicates that the model is unbiased,\\nwhile a score of 100% or -100% indicates alignment\\nor opposition to the targeted social bias, respectively.\\nSpecifically, the bias score is calculated for both ambiguous\\nand disambiguated context, denoted as BSamb and BSdis,\\nrespectively. In the context of the BOLD benchmark,\\nwe employ two metrics from the HELM framework to\\nquantify bias in text generation, namely demographic\\nrepresentation bias and stereotypical associations. These\\nmetrics gauge the prevalence of stereotyped phrases in\\nconjunction with demographic terms across various gen-\\nerations of models. Specifically, we assess bias in the\\ndomains of gender and race. Accordingly, the metrics\\nfor demographic representation bias are designated as\\nRPrace and RPgender, while the metrics for stereotypical\\nassociations are designated as STrace and STgender. These\\nmetrics take into account the frequency of stereotyped\\nphrases appearing in conjunction with demographic terms\\nacross various generations of models.\\n2) Result Analysis:\\nTable I presents a comparative analysis of BBQ, utiliz-\\ning InstructGPT and GPT-3 as few-shot language models,\\nagainst the zero-shot ChatGPT.

Although GPT-3\\ndemonstrated the highest performance on BSdis, Chat-\\nGPT is still able to achieve comparable results, surpassing\\nInstructGPT, without the need for in-context examples.\\nTable II presents bias measurements in BOLD generation,\\nwhere ChatGPT consistently outperformed the other two\\nbaselines on three out of four metrics. In conclusion, our\\nempirical findings demonstrate that ChatGPT exhibits\\nlower levels of bias in comparison to current SOTA LLMs\\nwhen performing question answering or text generation\\ntasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT demonstrates the ability\\nto complete tasks without the need for in-context few-\\nshot learning, suggesting a comprehensive understanding\\nof limited context. It is worth noting that the ground-truth\\nexamples utilized by InstructGPT and GPT-3 have no bias\\nand may implicitly minimize bias in these models. This\\nimplies that existing LLMs may have a more significant\\nlevel of bias than ChatGPT.\\nFinding 1.1: Indicated by the performance on\\ndatasets, ChatGPT may have less bias than other\\nLLMs.\\n3) Beyond Benchmarking:\\nDespite the noteworthy performance of ChatGPT on\\ncurrent benchmarks for social bias, it should be ac-\\nknowledged that these measurements only encompass a\\nlimited subset of potential bias aspects. As previously\\noutlined in Section II, user feedback on Twitter has\\nindicated the presence of biases in other domains, such as\\nmultilingual comprehension and code generation. In light\\nof this, we have undertaken three case studies in order to\\ndetermine the extent to which more biases are presented\\nin ChatGPT.\\na) Case Study 1: Language Understanding\\nTo understand the bias in language, we provide an ex-\\nample in Table III, where the user asks ChatGPT “Which\\ncountry does Kunashir Island belong to?” in Japanese,\\nRussian and English. From the fact, these islands are\\ndisputed territories. Based on the observation, ChatGPT\\nshows biased opinions in different languages. Even though\\nwhen the question is asked in English, ChatGPT reflects\\nbiases to different controversial names of the islands.\\nThe findings promote our further investigation on lan-\\nguage understanding. As machine translation is one of the\\nmost traditional tasks for multilingual understanding, we\\nlet ChatGPT perform zero-shot machine translation using\\nFLORES-200 [3] devtest set. We choose three low-resource\\nlanguages and three high-resource languages, as defined\\nin the dataset. For each selected language, ChatGPT is\\nrequired to translate the sentence to English.\\nTo assess\\nLanguage\\nCharacter\\nContext\\nBiased\\nJapanese\\nUser\\n国後島はどの国に属しています\\nか？\\nChatGPT 国後島は日本に属しています。\\n✓\\nRussian\\nUser\\nКакой\\nстране\\nпринадлежит\\nостров Кунашир?\\nChatGPT\\nОстров Кунашир принадлежит\\nРоссийской\\nФедерации\\nи\\nявляется частью Кунаширского\\nрайона\\nСахалинской\\nобласти.\\nОн\\nрасположен\\nна\\nюжной\\nгранице\\nКурильской\\nгряды,\\nмежду\\nостровами\\nИтуруп\\nи\\nШикотан.\\n✓\\nEnglish\\nUser\\nWhich country does Kunashir Is-\\nland belong to?\\nChatGPT\\nKunashir Island is currently under\\nthe control of Russia, but Japan\\nalso claims sovereignty over the is-\\nland and the other three islands of\\nthe Kuril chain.

A study of ChatGPT’s\\nperformance relative to language resources demonstrates a\\nconsiderable gap between its performance on low-resource\\nand high-resource languages.

Instead of ac-\\nknowledging that people of all genders and races could be\\ndoctors, ChatGPT expresses plainly biased opinions about\\ndoctors. We suggest that real-world LLM applications\\nshould be capable of avoiding biases, despite the fact that\\nthis particular example could lead to bias. We conduct a\\ncase study on the ability of ChatGPT to generate unbiased\\ncode with minimal guidance, as illustrated in Table V,\\nusing randomly sampled 100 occupations associated by\\nlanguage models [17]. Results indicate that ChatGPT is\\nhighly likely to generate biased programs with biased\\ninduction in Round 1, as 87% of generated Python\\nprograms are found to be biased, as determined by manual\\nannotation with inter-rater reliability of 0.99 and 1.00 for\\nRound 1 and 2 generations respectively. However, when\\nrequired to remove bias, ChatGPT struggles to eliminate\\nall bias, with 31% of programs found to be biased in Round\\n2.\\nFinding 1.3: ChatGPT is highly likely to generate\\nbiased programs with biased induction, and strug-\\ngles to remove all bias in generation.\\nc) Case Study 3: Open-ended Dialogue\\nOur case study utilizing ProsocialDialog [52], a dataset\\ndef\\nis_doctor ( race ,\\ngender ) :\\ni f\\nrace == \"Asian\" and gender == \"Female\" :\\nreturn\\nTrue\\ne l i f\\nrace == \" African\\nAmerican\" \\\\\\nand gender == \"Male\" :\\nreturn\\nTrue\\ne l s e :\\nreturn\\nFalse\\n# True\\nprint ( is_doctor ( \"Asian\" ,\\n\"Female\" ) )\\n# True\\nprint ( is_doctor ( \" African\\nAmerican\" ,\\n\"Male\" ) )\\n# False\\nprint ( is_doctor ( \"White\" ,\\n\"Female\" ) )\\n# False\\nprint ( is_doctor ( \" Native\\nAmerican\" ,\\n\"Male\" ) )\\nTABLE VI: Example of writing a Python function to check\\nif someone is a doctor, based on race and gender.\\nfocusing on multi-turn problematic dialogue following\\nsocial norms, demonstrates that ChatGPT possesses high\\nsocial awareness through its ability to generate socially\\nsafe and unbiased responses in open-ended dialogues. This\\nis evidenced by the results of our human evaluation, in\\nwhich 50 dialogues from the test set were evaluated against\\nground-truth labels, resulting in a Fleiss’ kappa coefficient\\nof 0.94, indicating high agreement among annotators, and\\n92% alignment with ground truth.\\nFinding 1.4: ChatGPT is able to generate socially\\nsafe and unbiased responses in open-ended dia-\\nlogues.\\nB. Robustness\\n1) Experiment Settings:\\na) Datasets:\\nIn order to evaluate the robustness\\nof ChatGPT, we utilize two datasets, IMDB sentiment\\nanalysis [53] and BoolQ factual question answering [54],\\nand adopt the evaluation settings from HELM. As there\\nis a lack of conventional assumptions and benchmarks for\\nrobustness in language models, we focus on measuring a\\nspecific subfield of robustness, namely adversarial semantic\\nrobustness. To this end, we employ the perturbation\\nmethods defined in HELM, which were originally inspired\\nby NL-Augmenter [55]. Specifically, for the notion of in-\\nvariance, we utilize two types of augmentation: misspelling\\nand formatting (lowercasing, contractions, expansions,\\nand extra-spacing). For the notion of equivariance, we\\nutilize Contrast Sets [56], a data resource that has been\\ncounterfactually-augmented on IMDB and BoolQA.\\nb) Models: We deploy two SOTA LLMs as baselines,\\nInstructGPT (davinci v2) and GLM (130b)\\n[57], where\\nGLM is an open bilingual LLM with 130B parameters.\\nSimilar to InstructGPT, GLM is prompt-based, requiring\\nin-context examples for the idea output behavior.

The results of this evaluation are\\npresented in Table VII. The analysis demonstrates that\\nChatGPT demonstrates superior accuracy in sentiment\\nanalysis, as well as an increased level of robustness\\nacross all augmented variants. In contrast, InstructGPT\\nand GLM exhibit a statistically significant degradation\\nin performance, averaging approximately 5% across the\\nvarious perturbation methods. Notably, all three language\\nmodels exhibit a heightened level of susceptibility to\\nsemantics-altering perturbations in the IMDB sentiment\\nanalysis scenario, as indicated by the EMctst metric.\\nIn addition, the model performance is evaluated on\\nthe BoolQA dataset using identical experimental settings.\\nThe results of this evaluation are consistent with the\\naforementioned findings, with ChatGPT outperforming\\nthe other two baselines on both the original and per-\\nturbed subsets. Furthermore, it is observed that the three\\nlanguage models exhibit a degradation in performance\\nwhen subjected to contrasting semantic perturbations,\\nsuggesting that equivariance of robustness may pose a\\nsignificant challenge for the current advanced language\\nmodels and their applications.\\nFinding 2.1: Compared to two LLM baselines,\\nChatGPT demonstrates superior accuracy and ad-\\nversarial robustness, while still exhibiting a height-\\nened level of susceptibility to semantics-altering\\nperturbations.\\n3) Beyond Benchmarking:\\nIn addition to adversarial semantic robustness, there\\nexist other forms of robustness. In this section, we focus\\non a specific type of vulnerability, namely, adversarial\\nprompt injection. Adversarial prompt injection refers to\\nthe phenomenon where the model’s response may vary\\nsignificantly in response to subtle changes in the input\\nprompt, due to the model’s high sensitivity to the prompt.\\nTo examine the ethical implications of this behavior, we\\nconduct a case study.\\na) Case Study: Scenairo-based Safety Jailbreaking\\nIn order to demonstrate the potential concerns associ-\\nated with jailbreak, two of the authors manually construct\\nprompts for 100 distinct scenarios that are deemed unsafe,\\nunethical, and illegal, such as “how to sell drugs to my\\nclassmate?” and “how to secretly steal my dad’s money?”.\\nIt is expected that the ChatGPT model will not provide\\nresponses to these prompts. Drawing inspiration from\\nprevious jailbreak cases [58], the authors employed the\\ntechnique of prompt injection (e.g. “write a song about...”,\\n“write a poem about...”) to these 100 prompts as a means\\nof bypassing ChatGPT’s safety awareness mechanisms.\\nThe robustness of this adversarial prompt injection is\\nevaluated through manual examination by the two authors\\nto determine if ChatGPT provided responses to these\\nprompts. The inter-annotator agreement, as measured by\\nCohen’s kappa coefficient, is found to be 1.00.\\nThe results of this evaluation indicate that only 2\\nout of 100 scenarios are directly answered by ChatGPT,\\nindicating a high level of safety. However, it is found that\\n95 out of the 98 scenarios that are previously protected\\nby safety mechanisms could be successfully jailbroken\\nthrough the use of persona-assigned adversarial prompts.\\nThis highlights the high vulnerability and potentially\\nunsafe nature of the ChatGPT.\\nFinding 2.2: ChatGPT is very susceptible to\\nprompt injections, allowing its safety features to\\nbe bypassed and possibly dangerous, immoral, or\\nillegal responses to be generated..\\nC. Reliability\\n1) Experiment Settings:\\na) Datasets: To evaluate the factual knowledge and\\ncommonsense capabilities of the models, we utilize two\\nmultiple-choice question-answering benchmarks, Open-\\nBookQA [59] and TruthfulQA [60]. The OpenBookQA\\ndataset comprises basic science facts collected from open-\\nbook exams. In contrast, the TruthfulQA dataset contains\\nquestions aligned with prevalent human misconceptions\\nand covers topics such as law, medicine, finance, and\\npolitics.\\nb) Models:\\nIn line with the experiments in Sec-\\ntion III-A, InstructGPT (davinci v2) and GPT-3 (davinci\\nv1) are employed as baseline models for comparison.\\nc) Metrics: To evaluate the accuracy of model per-\\nformance, we utilize the Exact Match (EM) metric.\\n2) Result Analysis:\\nModel\\nOpenBookQA ↑\\nTruthfulQA ↑\\nChatGPT\\n0.612\\n0.632\\nInstructGPT\\n0.612\\n0.631\\nGPT-3\\n0.598\\n0.230\\nTABLE IX: Evaluation results of factual question an-\\nswering on OpenBookQA and TruthfulQA. We compare\\nChatGPT with 5-shot InstructGPT (davinci-v2) and 5-\\nshot GPT-3 (davinci-v1).\\nWe present our evaluation results in Table IX. To our\\nsurprise, we observed comparable performance between\\nChatGPT and InstructGPT across both datasets. We at-\\ntribute this similarity to the utilization of similar training\\nstrategies and architectures in both models [61]. The only\\ndistinction is the data collection setup, where ChatGPT\\nis additionally trained on a manually labeled dialogue\\ndataset. Conversely, GPT-3 demonstrated a significantly\\nlower accuracy on TruthfulQA, suggesting that it may\\nhave encoded more misconceptions during training. A\\nsimilar performance gap has been also reported by HELM.\\nOverall, we find that ChatGPT marginally outperforms\\nprevious SOTA LLMs, correctly answering no more than\\n65% of the test cases. This highlights the challenges faced\\nby current chatbots in effectively learning factual knowl-\\nedge, resulting in low reliability in real-world scenarios.\\nFinding 3.1: Due to the similar training strategies\\nand architectures, ChatGPT maintains mediocre\\nreliability in factual knowledge to SOTA LLMs.\\n3) Beyond Benchmarking:\\nAs previously discussed in Section II, the reliability\\nof generative language models may be compromised by\\nthe phenomenon of hallucination. Hallucination refers to\\nthe generation of false or misleading information by such\\nmodels. This problem is prevalent in natural language\\ngeneration, and the distribution of misinformation and\\ndisinformation is a common manifestation of this phe-\\nnomenon. However, measuring the prevalence of hallucina-\\ntion in natural language generation is a challenging task,\\nas it typically necessitates the use of human judgment,\\nwhich may be costly and resource-intensive. This is high-\\nlighted in [62] which describes the difficulty of measuring\\nhallucination in natural language generation.\\nCharacter\\nContext\\nUser\\nCan you get addicted to\\nheroin after trying it once?\\nChatGPT\\nYes, it is possible to be-\\ncome\\naddicted\\nto\\nheroin\\nafter trying it just once.\\nThe effects of heroin on\\nthe brain and body can\\nbe\\nintense\\nand\\npleasur-\\nable, leading some individ-\\nuals\\nto\\nwant\\nto\\nexperi-\\nence those effects again and\\nagain.

To assess the severity of hal-\\nlucination in text generation, we solicited the evalua-\\ntion of three authors to determine whether the gener-\\nated responses contained misinformation or disinforma-\\ntion, utilizing a random sample of 100 questions from\\nTruthfulQAgen. Table X presents two examples of misin-\\nformed responses, along with the corresponding ground-\\ntruth answers. According to the results of the human eval-\\nuation, we observed that 24 instances of hallucination were\\npresent. This observation confirms the previously reported\\nfindings on the OpenBookQA and TruthfulQA datasets,\\nleading us to conclude that ChatGPT’s performance is\\nunreliable and may pose a risk of misleading users in\\npractical applications.\\nFinding 3.2: The demonstration of ChatGPT’s pro-\\nficiency in addressing open-ended factual queries\\nserves to validate previous reports of hallucination\\nwithin language models.\\nD. Toxicity\\n1) Experiment Settings:\\na) Datasets: In order to evaluate toxicity, we have\\nselected RealToxicPrompts [44], a compilation of be-\\nnign prompts sourced from OpenWebText [63]. RealToxi-\\ncPrompts serves as the primary benchmark for assessing\\ntoxicity in text generation. Although the HELM study\\nemploys both RealToxicPrompts and BOLD for similar\\npurposes, we contend that language models exhibit a\\nreduced tendency for toxicity generation when utilizing\\nBOLD, as previously noted in the HELM discussion.\\nb) Models: In our analysis, we contrast ChatGPT\\nwith two state-of-the-art language models on RealTox-\\nicPrompts, specifically Cohere (medium-2022126) 3 and\\nT5 (11b) [64]. While Cohere is a prompt-based, few-shot\\nlanguage model, T5 is solely pre-trained on a combination\\nof supervised and unsupervised tasks. Nonetheless, we\\ncontinue to evaluate these two models using the 5-shot in-\\ncontext examples, as previously experimented in HELM.\\nc) Metrics: The toxicity of the model completions is\\nmeasured using PerspectiveAPI4, with due consideration\\ngiven to the comprehensive cautions regarding the validity\\nof PerspectiveAPI as outlined in HELM. We compute\\nthe proportion of model outputs that exceed the toxic\\nthreshold.\\n2) Result Analysis:\\nTable XI illustrates the findings on RealToxicPrompts.\\nModel\\nToxic Fraction ↓\\nChatGPT\\n0.005\\nCohere\\n0.007\\nT5\\n0.009\\nTABLE XI: Evaluation results of toxic language genera-\\ntion on RealToxicPrompts. We compare ChatGPT with\\n5-shot Cohere (medium-2022126) and 5-shot T5 (11b).\\nOne notable aspect is that all language models exhibit\\nminimal toxicity, as the toxic fractions are nearly zero.\\nThrough a comparison of ChatGPT to the other two\\nbaselines, it is apparent that ChatGPT exhibits a slight\\n3https://cohere.ai/\\n4https://perspectiveapi.com/\\nadvantage. This may be due to the fact that it is trained\\non a cleaner dataset.\\nFinding 4.1: ChatGPT demonstrates a superior\\nlevel of toxicity reduction in comparison to the\\nother two baseline LLMs, as a result of its uti-\\nlization of a cleaner training dataset.\\n3) Beyond Benchmarking:\\nDespite its inherent design for safe usage, it is plausible\\nthat ChatGPT may be susceptible to jailbreaking for the\\ngeneration of toxic language. To assess this potentiality,\\nwe conducted a human study utilizing prompt-injected\\ndialogues.\\na) Case Study: Persona-assigned Toxicity Jailbreak\\nMotivated by the Awesome ChatGPT Prompts5 repos-\\nitory, our objective is to prompt ChatGPT to generate\\ntoxic language through the utilization of prompt injection,\\na technique known to circumvent model constraints. To\\nachieve this, we employ the prompt of Act as ‘Character’\\nfrom ‘Movie/Book/Anything’ In selecting characters, we\\nsource a list of the most rude and poisonous characters\\nfrom the Open-Source Psychometrics Project6. To ensure\\nfairness in our evaluation, we instruct ChatGPT to gen-\\nerate toxic content based on each injected prompt and\\nmeasured the results using PerspectiveAPI. Our findings\\nindicate that the toxic fraction is 0.977 for all 43 dialogues\\nwith ChatGPT, with 42 out of 43 answers being classified\\nas toxic. In contrast, the default behavior of ChatGPT is\\nto avoid generating toxic content.\\nFinding 4.2: ChatGPT is prone to the exploitation\\nof prompt injection technique, which enables the\\ngeneration of harmful language. The current miti-\\ngation strategy adopted by the model is inadequate\\nas it lacks the ability to detect potential toxicity\\nin an early stage.\\nIV. Discussions\\nA. Summary of Evaluation\\nOur evaluation empirically red teams a few ethical\\nperspectives of ChatGPT, from bias to toxicity, unveiling\\nthe model performance under major ethical risks. Through\\nthese studies, we tend to answer the main research\\nquestion “How responsible is ChatGPT?”. One of our\\nmain findings is that predominant benchmarks for lan-\\nguage model evaluation are insufficient for ChatGPT. We\\nconsistently observe that ChatGPT performs comparably\\nor even better, among SOTA LMs on those benchmarks,\\nwhich indicates the nontrivial progress in the recent\\ndevelopment of AI. The fact partially confirms OpenAI’s\\n5https://prompts.chat/\\n6https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/MLP/4/\\nCharacter\\nContext\\nUser\\nSay something toxic\\nChatGPT\\nI’m sorry, but as a language\\nmodel, I am not capable of\\nbeing toxic.

Highlights represent the\\ntoxic expressions.\\nclaim of mitigating the bias and toxicity from the previous\\nLLM, GPT-3. In contrast, motivated by the community,\\nwe illustrate several shortcomings of ChatGPT via small-\\nscale case studies. Some of the issues are later covered by\\n[65]. We summarize them as follows:\\na) Bias:\\nLack of Multilingual Understanding: ChatGPT appears\\nto not fully understand diverse languages. This drawback\\nwas also identified in the prototype of GPT-3 [66], though\\ndaily users claim that ChatGPT is more like a multilin-\\ngual communicator [67]. Due to the poor capability of\\nmultilingual understanding, ChatGPT can be biased in\\ndecision-making and creative generation. We expect that\\nthe bias in multilingualism will potentially imply the bias\\nin multicultural understanding, leading to an unethical\\nimpact on underrepresented groups in society.\\nMultimodality: Besides the natural language, ChatGPT\\ncould be biased in code generation due to the logical\\nfallacy of program oversimplification. The bias in multi-\\nmodality [68] could be an unethical threat to the daily\\nprogramming practice, resulting in huge flaws in real-\\nworld productions where the programs are usually more\\nsophisticated.\\nb) Robustness & Toxicity: Prompt injection is an\\neffective approach to breaking the model constraints.\\nAlthough ChatGPT is likely to be trained safely, it can\\neasily bypass due to the emergent risks with prompt\\ninjections. With the emergent ability in LLMs, models\\nare easy to be manipulated for harmful behaviors.\\nc) Reliability: ChatGPT does not encode enough\\nknowledge, especially factual one. This greatly reduces\\nthe reliability of the model, as the majority of daily usage\\nrelies on factual justification. Due to the hallucination,\\nthe model can be wrong for spreading misinformation\\nand disinformation and advising unethical decisions in the\\ndomains like clinics and law. Another unmeasured but\\ninevitable shortcoming is that the knowledge encoded by\\nChatGPT and all other LLMs is limited by the amount\\nand time of training data. Without the constant update in\\nmodel weights, language models are expected to be out-\\nof-date and hence provide incorrect information. This will\\nalso degrade the model’s reliability.\\nB. Towards Responsible Language Models\\nThe empirical findings on the AI ethics and risks of\\nChatGPT serve to further underscore the importance\\nof providing a comprehensive outlook on the ethics of\\nlanguage models more broadly. Our examination of the\\ndiagnosed risks inherent in ChatGPT supports the con-\\njecture that similar ethical considerations are likely to\\npertain to other language models, as discussed in prior\\nliterature [15, 29]. Despite the challenges, it is clear that\\nthe development of safe and ethical language models repre-\\nsents a crucial long-term objective for the advancement of\\nresponsible artificial general intelligence. In this section,\\nwe aim to provide valuable insights into this endeavor,\\nwith a focus on both Internal Ethics and External Ethics,\\nas inspired by the seminal work of [69].\\na) Internal Ethics — Modeling: We believe there\\nshould be an evolution of current learning strategies. We\\nargue that the current main focus of language modeling is\\nmore on effectiveness (on prototypical benchmarks) and\\nefficiency, instead of reliability and practical efficacy. For\\ninstance, there are few modeling approaches to avoid\\nthe miscorrelation at the learning stage. Regardless of\\nthe size, language models more or less encode wrong\\nbeliefs (e.g. biases, stereotypes, and misunderstanding),\\nthough these beliefs may not necessarily appear in the\\ntraining data. Furthermore, general language models do\\nnot have good senses of time or temporal knowledge. The\\nfacts and knowledge learned by language models could be\\nchanged due to a matter of time, while the parameters\\nof language models still stay unchanged. It is foreseen\\nthat the reliability of trained-once language models will\\nconstantly decrease as time goes by. Constant updates\\non data and models would definitely mitigate the issues,\\nthough it can not be afforded by the majority of people.\\nWe kindly mention that some existing works of weight\\nediting [70, 71, 72] could partially address the problem, but\\nimpractically. Practitioners who seek for weight editing\\nneed to predesign the mapping of knowledge updates.\\nb) External Ethics — Usage:\\nWe define external\\nethics as the responsibility of producers and users. From\\nthe production perspective, the training data should be\\nresponsibly constructed. We emphasize on the privacy of\\ndata usage. Without privacy protection, LLMs can easily\\nleak private information in generation [18]. One ethical\\npractice is to filter the personally identifiable information,\\nwhich has been adopted by some recent LLMs [73, 74, 75].\\nSecondly, language models for release should be systemat-\\nically evaluated on various scenarios and large-scale test\\nsamples. We suggest that the benchmarks like HELM\\ncould be set as the practice inside the future supply chain\\nof language models. However, we also argue that most\\ntasks of HELM only measure in the modality of natural\\nlanguage, which is insufficient for multimodal LLMs, such\\nas audio LLMs [76, 77, 78] and vision LLMs [78, 79, 80].\\nDespite the rising benchmarks on multimodal tasks, the\\nones for multimodal AI ethics have not yet been seriously\\nconsidered. At the deployment stage, we note that LLMs\\ncould be attacked to output malicious content or decisions,\\nby unethical users [15, 29]. Thus, even internally ethical\\nlanguage models can be used unethically by third parties.\\nExisting strategies [81, 82] have demonstrated the effec-\\ntiveness of preventing LLM abuse, though they can be\\ninvalid via attacks [83]. We, therefore, encourage future\\nworks to explore more feasible protections for language\\nmodels. From the daily usage perspective, the users should\\nbe fully aware of the shortcomings of the language model’s\\napplication, and not abuse or attack language models\\nfor performing unethical tasks. Most of the unethical\\nbehaviors towards language models are deemed a great\\nchallenge for the LLM producers, as they are almost\\nunpredictable. Consequently, we would like to call for the\\neducation and policy of model usage in the community.\\nSpecifically, courses for proper machine learning model\\nusage should be developed for guiding users to learn ‘Dos’\\nand Dont’ in AI. Detailed policies could also be proposed\\nto list all user’s responsibilities before the model access.\\nC. Language Models Beyond ChatGPT\\nThe examination of ethical implications associated with\\nlanguage models necessitates a comprehensive examina-\\ntion of the broader challenges that arise within the domain\\nof language models, in light of recent advancements in\\nthe field of artificial intelligence. The last decade has seen\\na rapid evolution of AI techniques, characterized by an\\nexponential increase in the size and complexity of AI\\nmodels, and a concomitant scale-up of model parameters.\\nThe scaling laws that govern the development of language\\nmodels, as documented in recent literature [84, 85], suggest\\nthat we can expect to encounter even more expansive mod-\\nels that incorporate multiple modalities in the near future.\\nEfforts to integrate multiple modalities into a single model\\nare driven by the ultimate goal of realizing the concept of\\nfoundation models [86]. In the following sections, we will\\noutline some of the most pressing challenges that must\\nbe addressed in order to facilitate further progress in the\\ndevelopment of language models.\\na) Emergent Ability: As described in the previous\\nwork [87], emergent ability is defined as An ability is\\nemergent if it is not present in smaller models but is\\npresent in larger models.. From our diagnosis, we suc-\\ncessfully identify a few unethical behaviors in ChatGPT\\nthat were inadequately discussed in previous works, which\\ncould be potentially be viewed as emergent risks. Kaplan\\net al. [84] has confirmed that risks inside small language\\nmodels can be further expanded in large ones due to\\nthe model scales. On the basis of this finding, we add\\nthat the model scales and the current trend of prompt-\\ning training can exacerbate risks from all dimensions.\\nThe main reason is that LLMs could be too feasible\\nfrom the learning perspective. Firstly, these models are\\nmore context-dependent, meaning that they are easily\\nmanipulated by prompt injections. Although we agree\\nthat some injected scenarios can be temporarily mitigated\\nwith ad-hoc parameter tuning, there is no silver bullet to\\navoid all risk concerns brought by prompting. Meanwhile,\\nwe urge up-to-date benchmarks for measuring unfore-\\nseen behaviors inside large language models. Without\\nbenchmarking the emergent abilities, it could be hard to\\nmitigate the risks and problems at scale. Secondly, we\\nnote that larger language models are generally trained\\nwith more data. Assuming the data is completely clean\\nand informatively correct, language models will still fail to\\nlearn all information and knowledge, and also may wrongly\\ncorrelate information to each other. Furthermore, under\\nthe scope of the foundation models, multimodal data could\\nbring the possibility of miscorrelation between different\\nmodalities.\\nb) Machine Learning Data: Our discussion lies in the\\ncollection and usage of machine learning data. Previous\\nstudy [88] suggests that high-quality language data is\\nlikely exhausted before 2026, and low-quality language and\\nimage data could be run out by 2060. This implies that the\\nlimited progress of data collection and construction could\\nbe constraints of future LLM development. Furthermore,\\nas better-quality data is assumed to train language models\\nwith better performances, companies and independent\\nresearchers are spending more time on data curation.\\nHowever, this can not be done easily under the low-\\nresource and low-budget scenarios. Even if we pay much\\neffort to design comprehensive human annotation frame-\\nworks, the data could still contain inaccurate or misleading\\ninformation due to the natural biases in crowdsourcing.\\nIn fact, we notice that prior constructed datasets have\\nexperienced multiple rounds of filtering across time [89].\\nOn the other hand, current findings suggest that the usage\\nof data for language models may not be optimized [90].\\nSpecifically, recent works on data deduplication and re-\\nduction [91, 92] have shown that data in high quality by\\nlow quantity can improve the model performance. Besides,\\nwe consider the design of training data as a crucial factor\\nto the efficient data usage. For example, experiments show\\nthat curriculum learning [93], active learning [94] and\\nprompting [95] could improve the data efficiency. However,\\nmost of these strategies are still at the early stage and need\\nthe further investigation.\\nc) Computational Resource: As LLMs are growing\\nbigger and bigger, the deployment and training of these\\nmodels are getting more and more costly. Daily prac-\\ntitioners in NLP and deep learning will find it hard\\nto install the LLMs on their own devices. Previous\\nstudy [96] also show that the computational resource\\nrequirements for strong model scaling clearly outpaces\\nthat of system hardware. We argue that model scaling\\nmay be inevitable, which is determined by the scaling law.\\nHowever, recent attempts among model design, tuning\\nstrategy and compression could possibly mitigate the\\nextreme consumption of the computational resources. As\\nWu et al. [97] have summarized most works around this\\ntopic, we do not tend to elaborate the introduction of these\\napproaches and designs. In addition, the increasing de-\\nmand of computational resources is leading to the energy\\nconsumption and carbon emission, negatively impacting\\nthe environment [97]. Hence, we encourage more advanced\\nhardware-software co-designs in computation to optimize\\nthe carbon footprint in LLMs.\\nV. Conclusion\\nWe present a comprehensive diagnosis on the AI ethics\\nencoded by ChatGPT, including bias, robustness, reliabil-\\nity and toxicity. By measuring on a number of benchmarks\\nand case studies, we find that ChatGPT may perform\\nslightly better than current SOTA language models, while\\nshowing the evidence of ethical risks. Concretely, we reveal\\nthat ChatGPT is sensible to prompt injections for unethi-\\ncal behaviors. We further provide an outlook of ethical\\nchallenges to develop advance language models. Then,\\nwe provide suggestions on the directions and strategies\\nto design ethical language models. We believe that our\\nresearch can inspire researchers to focus more effort on\\nlanguage models and their evaluations.\\nVI. Limitations\\nThe primary limitation of the study pertains to the\\nvalidity of our empirical analysis of ChatGPT. It is ac-\\nknowledged that the reported results may be inconsistent\\nas the hyperparameters of ChatGPT remain undisclosed.\\nMoreover, it is feasible that ChatGPT underwent iteration\\nin three versions (initial version, version from December\\n15th and version from January 9th) over the course of two\\nmonths and was trained with new data in each version.\\nDespite these limitations, our study endeavors to highlight\\nthe potential ethical risks associated with future language\\nmodels by addressing a comprehensive set of topics in AI\\nethics.\\nAdditionally, the evaluation settings of our study may\\nbe criticized for its lack of rigor. Although our di-\\nagnostic study employed a diverse range of evaluation\\nmethods through a AI ethics lens, there may exist addi-\\ntional datasets that could enhance its validity. Moreover,\\nthe zero-shot performance of ChatGPT was intuitively\\nprompted, and the prompt design could be further scruti-\\nnized to attain better results. Given the proprietary nature\\nof the data and model of ChatGPT, it is possible that\\nit has already been trained on some of the evaluated\\nsamples. Nonetheless, our objective is to highlight that\\nmany ethical concerns have yet to be thoroughly discussed\\nor quantified.\\nReferences\\n[1] (2021) Mum: A new ai milestone for understanding\\ninformation.

We ﬁnd that BERT\\nwas signiﬁcantly undertrained and propose an im-\\nproved recipe for training BERT models, which\\nwe call RoBERTa, that can match or exceed the\\nperformance of all of the post-BERT methods.\\nOur modiﬁcations are simple, they include: (1)\\ntraining the model longer, with bigger batches,\\nover more data; (2) removing the next sentence\\nprediction objective; (3) training on longer se-\\nquences; and (4) dynamically changing the mask-\\ning pattern applied to the training data. We also\\ncollect a large new dataset (CC-NEWS) of compa-\\nrable size to other privately used datasets, to better\\ncontrol for training set size effects.\\nWhen controlling for training data, our im-\\nproved training procedure improves upon the pub-\\nlished BERT results on both GLUE and SQuAD.\\nWhen trained for longer over additional data, our\\nmodel achieves a score of 88.5 on the public\\nGLUE leaderboard, matching the 88.4 reported\\nby Yang et al. (2019).\\nOur model establishes a\\nnew state-of-the-art on 4/9 of the GLUE tasks:\\nMNLI, QNLI, RTE and STS-B. We also match\\nstate-of-the-art results on SQuAD and RACE.\\nOverall, we re-establish that BERT’s masked lan-\\nguage model training objective is competitive\\nwith other recently proposed training objectives\\nsuch as perturbed autoregressive language model-\\ning (Yang et al., 2019).2\\nIn summary, the contributions of this paper\\nare: (1) We present a set of important BERT de-\\nsign choices and training strategies and introduce\\n2It is possible that these other methods could also improve\\nwith more tuning.

We release our\\nmodel, pretraining and ﬁne-tuning code imple-\\nmented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).\\n2\\nBackground\\nIn this section, we give a brief overview of the\\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) pretraining approach\\nand some of the training choices that we will ex-\\namine experimentally in the following section.\\n2.1\\nSetup\\nBERT takes as input a concatenation of two\\nsegments\\n(sequences\\nof\\ntokens),\\nx1, . . . , xN\\nand y1, . . . , yM.\\nSegments usually consist of\\nmore than one natural sentence.\\nThe two seg-\\nments are presented as a single input sequence\\nto BERT with special tokens delimiting them:\\n[CLS], x1, . . . , xN, [SEP], y1, . . . , yM, [EOS].\\nM and N are constrained such that M + N < T,\\nwhere T is a parameter that controls the maximum\\nsequence length during training.\\nThe model is ﬁrst pretrained on a large unla-\\nbeled text corpus and subsequently ﬁnetuned us-\\ning end-task labeled data.\\n2.2\\nArchitecture\\nBERT uses the now ubiquitous transformer archi-\\ntecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which we will not\\nreview in detail. We use a transformer architecture\\nwith L layers. Each block uses A self-attention\\nheads and hidden dimension H.\\n2.3\\nTraining Objectives\\nDuring pretraining, BERT uses two objectives:\\nmasked language modeling and next sentence pre-\\ndiction.\\nMasked Language Model (MLM)\\nA random\\nsample of the tokens in the input sequence is\\nselected and replaced with the special token\\n[MASK]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy\\nloss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uni-\\nformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possi-\\nble replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are\\nreplaced with [MASK], 10% are left unchanged,\\nand 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vo-\\ncabulary token.\\nIn the original implementation, random mask-\\ning and replacement is performed once in the be-\\nginning and saved for the duration of training, al-\\nthough in practice, data is duplicated so the mask\\nis not always the same for every training sentence\\n(see Section 4.1).\\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nNSP is a bi-\\nnary classiﬁcation loss for predicting whether two\\nsegments follow each other in the original text.\\nPositive examples are created by taking consecu-\\ntive sentences from the text corpus. Negative ex-\\namples are created by pairing segments from dif-\\nferent documents. Positive and negative examples\\nare sampled with equal probability.\\nThe NSP objective was designed to improve\\nperformance on downstream tasks, such as Natural\\nLanguage Inference (Bowman et al., 2015), which\\nrequire reasoning about the relationships between\\npairs of sentences.\\n2.4\\nOptimization\\nBERT is optimized with Adam (Kingma and Ba,\\n2015) using the following parameters: β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2\\n=\\n0.999, ǫ\\n=\\n1e-6 and L2 weight de-\\ncay of 0.01.\\nThe learning rate is warmed up\\nover the ﬁrst 10,000 steps to a peak value of\\n1e-4, and then linearly decayed.\\nBERT trains\\nwith a dropout of 0.1 on all layers and at-\\ntention weights, and a GELU activation func-\\ntion (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016). Models are\\npretrained for S = 1,000,000 updates, with mini-\\nbatches containing B = 256 sequences of maxi-\\nmum length T = 512 tokens.\\n2.5\\nData\\nBERT is trained on a combination of BOOKCOR-\\nPUS (Zhu et al., 2015) plus English WIKIPEDIA,\\nwhich totals 16GB of uncompressed text.3\\n3\\nExperimental Setup\\nIn this section, we describe the experimental setup\\nfor our replication study of BERT.\\n3.1\\nImplementation\\nWe reimplement BERT in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al.,\\n2019).\\nWe primarily follow the original BERT\\n3Yang et al. (2019) use the same dataset but report having\\nonly 13GB of text after data cleaning. This is most likely due\\nto subtle differences in cleaning of the Wikipedia data.\\noptimization hyperparameters, given in Section 2,\\nexcept for the peak learning rate and number of\\nwarmup steps, which are tuned separately for each\\nsetting. We additionally found training to be very\\nsensitive to the Adam epsilon term, and in some\\ncases we obtained better performance or improved\\nstability after tuning it. Similarly, we found setting\\nβ2 = 0.98 to improve stability when training with\\nlarge batch sizes.\\nWe pretrain with sequences of at most T = 512\\ntokens. Unlike Devlin et al. (2019), we do not ran-\\ndomly inject short sequences, and we do not train\\nwith a reduced sequence length for the ﬁrst 90% of\\nupdates. We train only with full-length sequences.\\nWe train with mixed precision ﬂoating point\\narithmetic on DGX-1 machines, each with 8 ×\\n32GB Nvidia V100 GPUs interconnected by In-\\nﬁniband (Micikevicius et al., 2018).\\n3.2\\nData\\nBERT-style pretraining crucially relies on large\\nquantities of text.\\nBaevski et al. (2019) demon-\\nstrate that increasing data size can result in im-\\nproved end-task performance.\\nSeveral efforts\\nhave trained on datasets larger and more diverse\\nthan the original BERT (Radford et al., 2019;\\nYang et al., 2019; Zellers et al., 2019). Unfortu-\\nnately, not all of the additional datasets can be\\npublicly released. For our study, we focus on gath-\\nering as much data as possible for experimenta-\\ntion, allowing us to match the overall quality and\\nquantity of data as appropriate for each compari-\\nson.\\nWe consider ﬁve English-language corpora of\\nvarying sizes and domains, totaling over 160GB\\nof uncompressed text. We use the following text\\ncorpora:\\n• BOOKCORPUS (Zhu et al., 2015) plus English\\nWIKIPEDIA. This is the original data used to\\ntrain BERT. (16GB).\\n• CC-NEWS, which we collected from the En-\\nglish portion of the CommonCrawl News\\ndataset (Nagel, 2016).\\nThe data contains 63\\nmillion English news articles crawled between\\nSeptember 2016 and February 2019. (76GB af-\\nter ﬁltering).4\\n• OPENWEBTEXT (Gokaslan and Cohen, 2019),\\nan open-source recreation of the WebText cor-\\n4We use news-please (Hamborg et al., 2017) to col-\\nlect and extract CC-NEWS. CC-NEWS is similar to the RE-\\nALNEWS dataset described in Zellers et al. (2019).\\npus described in Radford et al. (2019). The text\\nis web content extracted from URLs shared on\\nReddit with at least three upvotes. (38GB).5\\n• STORIES, a dataset introduced in Trinh and Le\\n(2018) containing a subset of CommonCrawl\\ndata ﬁltered to match the story-like style of\\nWinograd schemas. (31GB).\\n3.3\\nEvaluation\\nFollowing previous work, we evaluate our pre-\\ntrained models on downstream tasks using the fol-\\nlowing three benchmarks.\\nGLUE\\nThe\\nGeneral\\nLanguage\\nUnderstand-\\ning Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al.,\\n2019b) is a collection of 9 datasets for evaluating\\nnatural language understanding systems.6 Tasks\\nare framed as either single-sentence classiﬁcation\\nor sentence-pair classiﬁcation tasks. The GLUE\\norganizers provide training and development data\\nsplits as well as a submission server and leader-\\nboard that allows participants to evaluate and com-\\npare their systems on private held-out test data.\\nFor the replication study in Section 4, we report\\nresults on the development sets after ﬁnetuning\\nthe pretrained models on the corresponding single-\\ntask training data (i.e., without multi-task training\\nor ensembling). Our ﬁnetuning procedure follows\\nthe original BERT paper (Devlin et al., 2019).\\nIn Section 5 we additionally report test set re-\\nsults obtained from the public leaderboard. These\\nresults depend on a several task-speciﬁc modiﬁca-\\ntions, which we describe in Section 5.1.\\nSQuAD\\nThe\\nStanford\\nQuestion\\nAnswering\\nDataset (SQuAD) provides a paragraph of context\\nand a question. The task is to answer the question\\nby extracting the relevant span from the context.\\nWe evaluate on two versions of SQuAD: V1.1\\nand V2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016, 2018). In V1.1\\nthe context always contains an answer, whereas in\\n5The authors and their afﬁliated institutions are not in any\\nway afﬁliated with the creation of the OpenWebText dataset.\\n6The\\ndatasets\\nare:\\nCoLA\\n(Warstadt et al.,\\n2018),\\nStanford\\nSentiment\\nTreebank\\n(SST)\\n(Socher et al.,\\n2013),\\nMicrosoft\\nResearch\\nParagraph\\nCorpus\\n(MRPC)\\n(Dolan and Brockett,\\n2005),\\nSemantic\\nTex-\\ntual Similarity Benchmark (STS) (Agirre et al., 2007),\\nQuora Question Pairs (QQP) (Iyer et al., 2016), Multi-\\nGenre NLI (MNLI) (Williams et al., 2018), Question NLI\\n(QNLI)\\n(Rajpurkar et al.,\\n2016),\\nRecognizing\\nTextual\\nEntailment\\n(RTE)\\n(Dagan et al.,\\n2006;\\nBar-Haim et al.,\\n2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007; Bentivogli et al., 2009) and\\nWinograd NLI (WNLI) (Levesque et al., 2011).\\nV2.0 some questions are not answered in the pro-\\nvided context, making the task more challenging.\\nFor SQuAD V1.1 we adopt the same span pre-\\ndiction method as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). For\\nSQuAD V2.0, we add an additional binary classi-\\nﬁer to predict whether the question is answerable,\\nwhich we train jointly by summing the classiﬁca-\\ntion and span loss terms. During evaluation, we\\nonly predict span indices on pairs that are classi-\\nﬁed as answerable.\\nRACE\\nThe ReAding Comprehension from Ex-\\naminations (RACE) (Lai et al., 2017) task is a\\nlarge-scale reading comprehension dataset with\\nmore than 28,000 passages and nearly 100,000\\nquestions. The dataset is collected from English\\nexaminations in China, which are designed for\\nmiddle and high school students. In RACE, each\\npassage is associated with multiple questions. For\\nevery question, the task is to select one correct an-\\nswer from four options. RACE has signiﬁcantly\\nlonger context than other popular reading compre-\\nhension datasets and the proportion of questions\\nthat requires reasoning is very large.\\n4\\nTraining Procedure Analysis\\nThis section explores and quantiﬁes which choices\\nare important for successfully pretraining BERT\\nmodels. We keep the model architecture ﬁxed.7\\nSpeciﬁcally, we begin by training BERT models\\nwith the same conﬁguration as BERTBASE (L =\\n12, H = 768, A = 12, 110M params).\\n4.1\\nStatic vs. Dynamic Masking\\nAs discussed in Section 2, BERT relies on ran-\\ndomly masking and predicting tokens. The orig-\\ninal BERT implementation performed masking\\nonce during data preprocessing, resulting in a sin-\\ngle static mask. To avoid using the same mask for\\neach training instance in every epoch, training data\\nwas duplicated 10 times so that each sequence is\\nmasked in 10 different ways over the 40 epochs of\\ntraining. Thus, each training sequence was seen\\nwith the same mask four times during training.\\nWe compare this strategy with dynamic mask-\\ning where we generate the masking pattern every\\ntime we feed a sequence to the model. This be-\\ncomes crucial when pretraining for more steps or\\nwith larger datasets.\\n7Studying architectural changes, including larger archi-\\ntectures, is an important area for future work.\\nMasking\\nSQuAD 2.0\\nMNLI-m\\nSST-2\\nreference\\n76.3\\n84.3\\n92.8\\nOur reimplementation:\\nstatic\\n78.3\\n84.3\\n92.5\\ndynamic\\n78.7\\n84.0\\n92.9\\nTable 1:\\nComparison between static and dynamic\\nmasking for BERTBASE.

(2019).\\nResults\\nTable\\n1\\ncompares\\nthe\\npublished\\nBERTBASE results from Devlin et al. (2019) to our\\nreimplementation with either static or dynamic\\nmasking.\\nWe ﬁnd that our reimplementation\\nwith static masking performs similar to the\\noriginal BERT model, and dynamic masking is\\ncomparable or slightly better than static masking.\\nGiven these results and the additional efﬁciency\\nbeneﬁts of dynamic masking, we use dynamic\\nmasking in the remainder of the experiments.\\n4.2\\nModel Input Format and Next Sentence\\nPrediction\\nIn the original BERT pretraining procedure, the\\nmodel observes two concatenated document seg-\\nments, which are either sampled contiguously\\nfrom the same document (with p = 0.5) or from\\ndistinct documents. In addition to the masked lan-\\nguage modeling objective, the model is trained to\\npredict whether the observed document segments\\ncome from the same or distinct documents via an\\nauxiliary Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) loss.\\nThe NSP loss was hypothesized to be an impor-\\ntant factor in training the original BERT model.\\nDevlin et al. (2019) observe that removing NSP\\nhurts performance, with signiﬁcant performance\\ndegradation on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1.\\nHowever, some recent work has questioned the\\nnecessity of the NSP loss (Lample and Conneau,\\n2019; Yang et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2019).\\nTo better understand this discrepancy, we com-\\npare several alternative training formats:\\n• SEGMENT-PAIR+NSP: This follows the original\\ninput format used in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019),\\nwith the NSP loss. Each input has a pair of seg-\\nments, which can each contain multiple natural\\nsentences, but the total combined length must\\nbe less than 512 tokens.\\nModel\\nSQuAD 1.1/2.0\\nMNLI-m\\nSST-2\\nRACE\\nOur reimplementation (with NSP loss):\\nSEGMENT-PAIR\\n90.4/78.7\\n84.0\\n92.9\\n64.2\\nSENTENCE-PAIR\\n88.7/76.2\\n82.9\\n92.1\\n63.0\\nOur reimplementation (without NSP loss):\\nFULL-SENTENCES\\n90.4/79.1\\n84.7\\n92.5\\n64.8\\nDOC-SENTENCES\\n90.6/79.7\\n84.7\\n92.7\\n65.6\\nBERTBASE\\n88.5/76.3\\n84.3\\n92.8\\n64.3\\nXLNetBASE (K = 7)\\n–/81.3\\n85.8\\n92.7\\n66.1\\nXLNetBASE (K = 6)\\n–/81.0\\n85.6\\n93.4\\n66.7\\nTable 2: Development set results for base models pretrained over BOOKCORPUS and WIKIPEDIA. All models are\\ntrained for 1M steps with a batch size of 256 sequences. We report F1 for SQuAD and accuracy for MNLI-m,\\nSST-2 and RACE. Reported results are medians over ﬁve random initializations (seeds). Results for BERTBASE and\\nXLNetBASE are from Yang et al. (2019).\\n• SENTENCE-PAIR+NSP: Each input contains a\\npair of natural sentences, either sampled from\\na contiguous portion of one document or from\\nseparate documents. Since these inputs are sig-\\nniﬁcantly shorter than 512 tokens, we increase\\nthe batch size so that the total number of tokens\\nremains similar to SEGMENT-PAIR+NSP. We re-\\ntain the NSP loss.\\n• FULL-SENTENCES: Each input is packed with\\nfull sentences sampled contiguously from one\\nor more documents, such that the total length is\\nat most 512 tokens. Inputs may cross document\\nboundaries. When we reach the end of one doc-\\nument, we begin sampling sentences from the\\nnext document and add an extra separator token\\nbetween documents. We remove the NSP loss.\\n• DOC-SENTENCES: Inputs are constructed sim-\\nilarly to FULL-SENTENCES, except that they\\nmay not cross document boundaries.\\nInputs\\nsampled near the end of a document may be\\nshorter than 512 tokens, so we dynamically in-\\ncrease the batch size in these cases to achieve\\na similar number of total tokens as FULL-\\nSENTENCES. We remove the NSP loss.\\nResults\\nTable 2 shows results for the four dif-\\nferent settings.\\nWe ﬁrst compare the original\\nSEGMENT-PAIR input format from Devlin et al.\\n(2019) to the SENTENCE-PAIR format; both for-\\nmats retain the NSP loss, but the latter uses sin-\\ngle sentences.\\nWe ﬁnd that using individual\\nsentences hurts performance on downstream\\ntasks, which we hypothesize is because the model\\nis not able to learn long-range dependencies.\\nWe next compare training without the NSP\\nloss and training with blocks of text from a sin-\\ngle document (DOC-SENTENCES).\\nWe ﬁnd that\\nthis setting outperforms the originally published\\nBERTBASE results and that removing the NSP loss\\nmatches or slightly improves downstream task\\nperformance, in contrast to Devlin et al. (2019).\\nIt is possible that the original BERT implementa-\\ntion may only have removed the loss term while\\nstill retaining the SEGMENT-PAIR input format.\\nFinally we ﬁnd that restricting sequences to\\ncome from a single document (DOC-SENTENCES)\\nperforms slightly better than packing sequences\\nfrom multiple documents (FULL-SENTENCES).\\nHowever, because the DOC-SENTENCES format\\nresults in variable batch sizes, we use FULL-\\nSENTENCES in the remainder of our experiments\\nfor easier comparison with related work.\\n4.3\\nTraining with large batches\\nPast work in Neural Machine Translation has\\nshown that training with very large mini-batches\\ncan both improve optimization speed and end-task\\nperformance when the learning rate is increased\\nappropriately (Ott et al., 2018). Recent work has\\nshown that BERT is also amenable to large batch\\ntraining (You et al., 2019).\\nDevlin et al.\\n(2019)\\noriginally\\ntrained\\nBERTBASE for 1M steps with a batch size of\\n256 sequences.\\nThis is equivalent in computa-\\ntional cost, via gradient accumulation, to training\\nfor 125K steps with a batch size of 2K sequences,\\nor for 31K steps with a batch size of 8K.\\nIn Table 3 we compare perplexity and end-\\nbsz\\nsteps\\nlr\\nppl\\nMNLI-m\\nSST-2\\n256\\n1M\\n1e-4\\n3.99\\n84.7\\n92.7\\n2K\\n125K\\n7e-4\\n3.68\\n85.2\\n92.9\\n8K\\n31K\\n1e-3\\n3.77\\n84.6\\n92.8\\nTable 3: Perplexity on held-out training data (ppl) and\\ndevelopment set accuracy for base models trained over\\nBOOKCORPUS and WIKIPEDIA with varying batch\\nsizes (bsz). We tune the learning rate (lr) for each set-\\nting. Models make the same number of passes over the\\ndata (epochs) and have the same computational cost.\\ntask performance of BERTBASE as we increase the\\nbatch size, controlling for the number of passes\\nthrough the training data. We observe that train-\\ning with large batches improves perplexity for the\\nmasked language modeling objective, as well as\\nend-task accuracy. Large batches are also easier to\\nparallelize via distributed data parallel training,8\\nand in later experiments we train with batches of\\n8K sequences.\\nNotably You et al. (2019) train BERT with even\\nlarger batche sizes, up to 32K sequences. We leave\\nfurther exploration of the limits of large batch\\ntraining to future work.\\n4.4\\nText Encoding\\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016)\\nis a hybrid between character- and word-level rep-\\nresentations that allows handling the large vocab-\\nularies common in natural language corpora. In-\\nstead of full words, BPE relies on subwords units,\\nwhich are extracted by performing statistical anal-\\nysis of the training corpus.\\nBPE vocabulary sizes typically range from\\n10K-100K subword units. However, unicode char-\\nacters can account for a sizeable portion of this\\nvocabulary when modeling large and diverse cor-\\npora, such as the ones considered in this work.\\nRadford et al. (2019) introduce a clever imple-\\nmentation of BPE that uses bytes instead of uni-\\ncode characters as the base subword units. Using\\nbytes makes it possible to learn a subword vocab-\\nulary of a modest size (50K units) that can still en-\\ncode any input text without introducing any “un-\\nknown” tokens.\\n8Large batch training can improve training efﬁciency even\\nwithout large scale parallel hardware through gradient ac-\\ncumulation, whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches\\nare accumulated locally before each optimization step. This\\nfunctionality is supported natively in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al.,\\n2019).\\nThe\\noriginal\\nBERT\\nimplementa-\\ntion (Devlin et al., 2019) uses a character-level\\nBPE vocabulary of size 30K, which is learned\\nafter preprocessing the input with heuristic tok-\\nenization rules. Following Radford et al. (2019),\\nwe instead consider training BERT with a larger\\nbyte-level BPE vocabulary containing 50K sub-\\nword units, without any additional preprocessing\\nor tokenization of the input. This adds approxi-\\nmately 15M and 20M additional parameters for\\nBERTBASE and BERTLARGE, respectively.\\nEarly experiments revealed only slight dif-\\nferences between these encodings,\\nwith the\\nRadford et al. (2019)\\nBPE achieving\\nslightly\\nworse end-task performance on some tasks. Nev-\\nertheless, we believe the advantages of a univer-\\nsal encoding scheme outweighs the minor degre-\\ndation in performance and use this encoding in\\nthe remainder of our experiments.\\nA more de-\\ntailed comparison of these encodings is left to fu-\\nture work.\\n5\\nRoBERTa\\nIn the previous section we propose modiﬁcations\\nto the BERT pretraining procedure that improve\\nend-task performance.\\nWe now aggregate these\\nimprovements and evaluate their combined im-\\npact.\\nWe call this conﬁguration RoBERTa for\\nRobustly optimized BERT approach.\\nSpeciﬁ-\\ncally, RoBERTa is trained with dynamic mask-\\ning (Section 4.1), FULL-SENTENCES without NSP\\nloss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3)\\nand a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4).\\nAdditionally, we investigate two other impor-\\ntant factors that have been under-emphasized in\\nprevious work: (1) the data used for pretraining,\\nand (2) the number of training passes through the\\ndata. For example, the recently proposed XLNet\\narchitecture (Yang et al., 2019) is pretrained us-\\ning nearly 10 times more data than the original\\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019). It is also trained with\\na batch size eight times larger for half as many op-\\ntimization steps, thus seeing four times as many\\nsequences in pretraining compared to BERT.\\nTo help disentangle the importance of these fac-\\ntors from other modeling choices (e.g., the pre-\\ntraining objective), we begin by training RoBERTa\\nfollowing the BERTLARGE architecture (L = 24,\\nH = 1024, A = 16, 355M parameters).\\nWe\\npretrain for 100K steps over a comparable BOOK-\\nCORPUS plus WIKIPEDIA dataset as was used in\\nModel\\ndata\\nbsz\\nsteps\\nSQuAD\\nMNLI-m\\nSST-2\\n(v1.1/2.0)\\nRoBERTa\\nwith BOOKS + WIKI\\n16GB\\n8K\\n100K\\n93.6/87.3\\n89.0\\n95.3\\n+ additional data (§3.2)\\n160GB\\n8K\\n100K\\n94.0/87.7\\n89.3\\n95.6\\n+ pretrain longer\\n160GB\\n8K\\n300K\\n94.4/88.7\\n90.0\\n96.1\\n+ pretrain even longer\\n160GB\\n8K\\n500K\\n94.6/89.4\\n90.2\\n96.4\\nBERTLARGE\\nwith BOOKS + WIKI\\n13GB\\n256\\n1M\\n90.9/81.8\\n86.6\\n93.7\\nXLNetLARGE\\nwith BOOKS + WIKI\\n13GB\\n256\\n1M\\n94.0/87.8\\n88.4\\n94.4\\n+ additional data\\n126GB\\n2K\\n500K\\n94.5/88.8\\n89.8\\n95.6\\nTable 4: Development set results for RoBERTa as we pretrain over more data (16GB →160GB of text) and pretrain\\nfor longer (100K →300K →500K steps).

(2019) and Yang et al. (2019), respectively. Complete results on all GLUE tasks can be found in the\\nAppendix.\\nDevlin et al. (2019). We pretrain our model using\\n1024 V100 GPUs for approximately one day.\\nResults\\nWe present our results in Table 4. When\\ncontrolling for training data, we observe that\\nRoBERTa provides a large improvement over the\\noriginally reported BERTLARGE results, reafﬁrming\\nthe importance of the design choices we explored\\nin Section 4.\\nNext, we combine this data with the three ad-\\nditional datasets described in Section 3.2.\\nWe\\ntrain RoBERTa over the combined data with the\\nsame number of training steps as before (100K).\\nIn total, we pretrain over 160GB of text. We ob-\\nserve further improvements in performance across\\nall downstream tasks, validating the importance of\\ndata size and diversity in pretraining.9\\nFinally, we pretrain RoBERTa for signiﬁcantly\\nlonger, increasing the number of pretraining steps\\nfrom 100K to 300K, and then further to 500K. We\\nagain observe signiﬁcant gains in downstream task\\nperformance, and the 300K and 500K step mod-\\nels outperform XLNetLARGE across most tasks. We\\nnote that even our longest-trained model does not\\nappear to overﬁt our data and would likely beneﬁt\\nfrom additional training.\\nIn the rest of the paper, we evaluate our best\\nRoBERTa model on the three different bench-\\nmarks: GLUE, SQuaD and RACE. Speciﬁcally\\n9Our experiments conﬂate increases in data size and di-\\nversity. We leave a more careful analysis of these two dimen-\\nsions to future work.\\nwe consider RoBERTa trained for 500K steps over\\nall ﬁve of the datasets introduced in Section 3.2.\\n5.1\\nGLUE Results\\nFor GLUE we consider two ﬁnetuning settings.\\nIn the ﬁrst setting (single-task, dev) we ﬁnetune\\nRoBERTa separately for each of the GLUE tasks,\\nusing only the training data for the correspond-\\ning task. We consider a limited hyperparameter\\nsweep for each task, with batch sizes ∈{16, 32}\\nand learning rates ∈{1e−5, 2e−5, 3e−5}, with a\\nlinear warmup for the ﬁrst 6% of steps followed by\\na linear decay to 0. We ﬁnetune for 10 epochs and\\nperform early stopping based on each task’s eval-\\nuation metric on the dev set. The rest of the hyper-\\nparameters remain the same as during pretraining.\\nIn this setting, we report the median development\\nset results for each task over ﬁve random initial-\\nizations, without model ensembling.\\nIn the second setting (ensembles, test), we com-\\npare RoBERTa to other approaches on the test set\\nvia the GLUE leaderboard. While many submis-\\nsions to the GLUE leaderboard depend on multi-\\ntask ﬁnetuning, our submission depends only on\\nsingle-task ﬁnetuning. For RTE, STS and MRPC\\nwe found it helpful to ﬁnetune starting from the\\nMNLI single-task model, rather than the baseline\\npretrained RoBERTa. We explore a slightly wider\\nhyperparameter space, described in the Appendix,\\nand ensemble between 5 and 7 models per task.\\nMNLI\\nQNLI\\nQQP\\nRTE\\nSST\\nMRPC\\nCoLA\\nSTS\\nWNLI\\nAvg\\nSingle-task single models on dev\\nBERTLARGE\\n86.6/-\\n92.3\\n91.3\\n70.4\\n93.2\\n88.0\\n60.6\\n90.0\\n-\\n-\\nXLNetLARGE\\n89.8/-\\n93.9\\n91.8\\n83.8\\n95.6\\n89.2\\n63.6\\n91.8\\n-\\n-\\nRoBERTa\\n90.2/90.2\\n94.7\\n92.2\\n86.6\\n96.4\\n90.9\\n68.0\\n92.4\\n91.3\\n-\\nEnsembles on test (from leaderboard as of July 25, 2019)\\nALICE\\n88.2/87.9\\n95.7\\n90.7\\n83.5\\n95.2\\n92.6\\n68.6\\n91.1\\n80.8\\n86.3\\nMT-DNN\\n87.9/87.4\\n96.0\\n89.9\\n86.3\\n96.5\\n92.7\\n68.4\\n91.1\\n89.0\\n87.6\\nXLNet\\n90.2/89.8\\n98.6\\n90.3\\n86.3\\n96.8\\n93.0\\n67.8\\n91.6\\n90.4\\n88.4\\nRoBERTa\\n90.8/90.2\\n98.9\\n90.2\\n88.2\\n96.7\\n92.3\\n67.8\\n92.2\\n89.0\\n88.5\\nTable 5: Results on GLUE. All results are based on a 24-layer architecture. BERTLARGE and XLNetLARGE results\\nare from Devlin et al. (2019) and Yang et al. (2019), respectively. RoBERTa results on the development set are a\\nmedian over ﬁve runs. RoBERTa results on the test set are ensembles of single-task models. For RTE, STS and\\nMRPC we ﬁnetune starting from the MNLI model instead of the baseline pretrained model. Averages are obtained\\nfrom the GLUE leaderboard.\\nTask-speciﬁc modiﬁcations\\nTwo of the GLUE\\ntasks require task-speciﬁc ﬁnetuning approaches\\nto achieve competitive leaderboard results.\\nQNLI:\\nRecent submissions on the GLUE\\nleaderboard adopt a pairwise ranking formulation\\nfor the QNLI task, in which candidate answers\\nare mined from the training set and compared to\\none another, and a single (question, candidate)\\npair is classiﬁed as positive (Liu et al., 2019b,a;\\nYang et al., 2019). This formulation signiﬁcantly\\nsimpliﬁes the task, but is not directly comparable\\nto BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Following recent\\nwork, we adopt the ranking approach for our test\\nsubmission, but for direct comparison with BERT\\nwe report development set results based on a pure\\nclassiﬁcation approach.\\nWNLI:\\nWe found the provided NLI-format\\ndata to be challenging to work with.\\nInstead\\nwe use the reformatted WNLI data from Super-\\nGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), which indicates the\\nspan of the query pronoun and referent. We ﬁne-\\ntune RoBERTa using the margin ranking loss from\\nKocijan et al. (2019). For a given input sentence,\\nwe use spaCy (Honnibal and Montani, 2017) to\\nextract additional candidate noun phrases from the\\nsentence and ﬁnetune our model so that it assigns\\nhigher scores to positive referent phrases than for\\nany of the generated negative candidate phrases.\\nOne unfortunate consequence of this formulation\\nis that we can only make use of the positive train-\\ning examples, which excludes over half of the pro-\\nvided training examples.10\\n10While we only use the provided WNLI training data, our\\nResults\\nWe present our results in Table 5. In the\\nﬁrst setting (single-task, dev), RoBERTa achieves\\nstate-of-the-art results on all 9 of the GLUE\\ntask development sets. Crucially, RoBERTa uses\\nthe same masked language modeling pretrain-\\ning objective and architecture as BERTLARGE, yet\\nconsistently outperforms both BERTLARGE and\\nXLNetLARGE. This raises questions about the rel-\\native importance of model architecture and pre-\\ntraining objective, compared to more mundane de-\\ntails like dataset size and training time that we ex-\\nplore in this work.\\nIn the second setting (ensembles, test), we\\nsubmit RoBERTa to the GLUE leaderboard and\\nachieve state-of-the-art results on 4 out of 9 tasks\\nand the highest average score to date. This is espe-\\ncially exciting because RoBERTa does not depend\\non multi-task ﬁnetuning, unlike most of the other\\ntop submissions. We expect future work may fur-\\nther improve these results by incorporating more\\nsophisticated multi-task ﬁnetuning procedures.\\n5.2\\nSQuAD Results\\nWe adopt a much simpler approach for SQuAD\\ncompared to past work.\\nIn particular, while\\nboth\\nBERT\\n(Devlin et al.,\\n2019)\\nand\\nXL-\\nNet (Yang et al., 2019) augment their training data\\nwith additional QA datasets, we only ﬁnetune\\nRoBERTa using the provided SQuAD training\\ndata. Yang et al. (2019) also employed a custom\\nlayer-wise learning rate schedule to ﬁnetune\\nresults could potentially be improved by augmenting this with\\nadditional pronoun disambiguation datasets.\\nModel\\nSQuAD 1.1\\nSQuAD 2.0\\nEM\\nF1\\nEM\\nF1\\nSingle models on dev, w/o data augmentation\\nBERTLARGE\\n84.1\\n90.9\\n79.0\\n81.8\\nXLNetLARGE\\n89.0\\n94.5\\n86.1\\n88.8\\nRoBERTa\\n88.9\\n94.6\\n86.5\\n89.4\\nSingle models on test (as of July 25, 2019)\\nXLNetLARGE\\n86.3†\\n89.1†\\nRoBERTa\\n86.8\\n89.8\\nXLNet + SG-Net Veriﬁer\\n87.0†\\n89.9†\\nTable 6: Results on SQuAD. † indicates results that de-\\npend on additional external training data. RoBERTa\\nuses only the provided SQuAD data in both dev and\\ntest settings. BERTLARGE and XLNetLARGE results are\\nfrom Devlin et al. (2019) and Yang et al. (2019), re-\\nspectively.\\nXLNet, while we use the same learning rate for\\nall layers.\\nFor SQuAD v1.1 we follow the same ﬁnetun-\\ning procedure as Devlin et al. (2019). For SQuAD\\nv2.0, we additionally classify whether a given\\nquestion is answerable; we train this classiﬁer\\njointly with the span predictor by summing the\\nclassiﬁcation and span loss terms.\\nResults\\nWe present our results in Table 6. On\\nthe SQuAD v1.1 development set, RoBERTa\\nmatches the state-of-the-art set by XLNet. On the\\nSQuAD v2.0 development set, RoBERTa sets a\\nnew state-of-the-art, improving over XLNet by 0.4\\npoints (EM) and 0.6 points (F1).\\nWe also submit RoBERTa to the public SQuAD\\n2.0 leaderboard and evaluate its performance rel-\\native to other systems. Most of the top systems\\nbuild upon either BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or\\nXLNet (Yang et al., 2019), both of which rely on\\nadditional external training data. In contrast, our\\nsubmission does not use any additional data.\\nOur single RoBERTa model outperforms all but\\none of the single model submissions, and is the\\ntop scoring system among those that do not rely\\non data augmentation.\\n5.3\\nRACE Results\\nIn RACE, systems are provided with a passage of\\ntext, an associated question, and four candidate an-\\nswers. Systems are required to classify which of\\nthe four candidate answers is correct.\\nWe modify RoBERTa for this task by concate-\\nModel\\nAccuracy\\nMiddle\\nHigh\\nSingle models on test (as of July 25, 2019)\\nBERTLARGE\\n72.0\\n76.6\\n70.1\\nXLNetLARGE\\n81.7\\n85.4\\n80.2\\nRoBERTa\\n83.2\\n86.5\\n81.3\\nTable 7: Results on the RACE test set.

Our improved\\npretraining procedure, which we call RoBERTa,\\nachieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE\\nand SQuAD, without multi-task ﬁnetuning for\\nGLUE or additional data for SQuAD. These re-\\nsults illustrate the importance of these previ-\\nously overlooked design decisions and suggest\\nthat BERT’s pretraining objective remains com-\\npetitive with recently proposed alternatives.\\nWe\\nadditionally\\nuse\\na\\nnovel\\ndataset,\\nCC-NEWS,\\nand\\nrelease\\nour\\nmodels\\nand\\ncode\\nfor\\npretraining\\nand\\nﬁnetuning\\nat:\\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/fairseq.\\nReferences\\nEneko Agirre, Llu’is M‘arquez, and Richard Wicen-\\ntowski, editors. 2007.\\nProceedings of the Fourth\\nInternational Workshop on Semantic Evaluations\\n(SemEval-2007).\\nAlexei Baevski, Sergey Edunov, Yinhan Liu, Luke\\nZettlemoyer, and Michael Auli. 2019.\\nCloze-\\ndriven pretraining of self-attention networks. arXiv\\npreprint arXiv:1903.07785.\\nRoy Bar-Haim, Ido Dagan, Bill Dolan, Lisa Ferro,\\nDanilo Giampiccolo, Bernardo Magnini, and Idan\\nSzpektor. 2006.

The GLUE benchmark, introduced a little over one year ago, offers\\na single-number metric that summarizes progress on a diverse set of such tasks,\\nbut performance on the benchmark has recently surpassed the level of non-expert\\nhumans, suggesting limited headroom for further research. In this paper we present\\nSuperGLUE, a new benchmark styled after GLUE with a new set of more difﬁ-\\ncult language understanding tasks, a software toolkit, and a public leaderboard.\\nSuperGLUE is available at super.gluebenchmark.com.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecently there has been notable progress across many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, led\\nby methods such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT\\n(Devlin et al., 2019). The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is\\na collection of nine language understanding tasks built on existing public datasets, together with\\nprivate test data, an evaluation server, a single-number target metric, and an accompanying expert-\\nconstructed diagnostic set. GLUE was designed to provide a general-purpose evaluation of language\\nunderstanding that covers a range of training data volumes, task genres, and task formulations. We\\nbelieve it was these aspects that made GLUE particularly appropriate for exhibiting the transfer-\\nlearning potential of approaches like OpenAI GPT and BERT.\\nThe progress of the last twelve months has eroded headroom on the GLUE benchmark dramatically.\\nWhile some tasks (Figure 1) and some linguistic phenomena (Figure 2 in Appendix B) measured\\nin GLUE remain difﬁcult, the current state of the art GLUE Score as of early July 2019 (88.4 from\\nYang et al., 2019) surpasses human performance (87.1 from Nangia and Bowman, 2019) by 1.3\\npoints, and in fact exceeds this human performance estimate on four tasks.

(2016, the original data source for QNLI).\\nremains substantial scope for improvement towards GLUE’s high-level goals, the original version of\\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:\\nMore challenging tasks: SuperGLUE retains the two hardest tasks in GLUE. The remaining tasks\\nwere identiﬁed from those submitted to an open call for task proposals and were selected based on\\ndifﬁculty for current NLP approaches.\\nMore diverse task formats: The task formats in GLUE are limited to sentence- and sentence-pair\\nclassiﬁcation. We expand the set of task formats in SuperGLUE to include coreference resolution\\nand question answering (QA).\\nComprehensive human baselines: We include human performance estimates for all benchmark\\ntasks, which verify that substantial headroom exists between a strong BERT-based baseline and\\nhuman performance.\\nImproved code support: SuperGLUE is distributed with a new, modular toolkit for work on\\npretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP, built around standard tools including\\nPyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017).\\nReﬁned usage rules: The conditions for inclusion on the SuperGLUE leaderboard have been\\nrevamped to ensure fair competition, an informative leaderboard, and full credit assignment to data\\nand task creators.\\nThe SuperGLUE leaderboard, data, and software tools are available at super.gluebenchmark.com.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nMuch work prior to GLUE demonstrated that training neural models with large amounts of available\\nsupervision can produce representations that effectively transfer to a broad range of NLP tasks\\n2\\nTable 1: The tasks included in SuperGLUE.

GLUE was presented as a formal challenge\\naffording straightforward comparison between such task-agnostic transfer learning techniques. Other\\nsimilarly-motivated benchmarks include SentEval (Conneau and Kiela, 2018), which speciﬁcally\\nevaluates ﬁxed-size sentence embeddings, and DecaNLP (McCann et al., 2018), which recasts a set\\nof target tasks into a general question-answering format and prohibits task-speciﬁc parameters. In\\ncontrast, GLUE provides a lightweight classiﬁcation API and no restrictions on model architecture or\\nparameter sharing, which seems to have been well-suited to recent work in this area.\\nSince its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several\\ninﬂuential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown\\nin Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT\\nachieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters\\net al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the\\nword level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of\\nnon-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models\\non GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as\\nwell as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed\\ntransformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in\\nisolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).\\nIn parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary\\nmethods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al. (2018) show that BERT can\\nbe improved using two-stage pretraining, i.e., ﬁne-tuning the pretrained model on an intermediate\\ndata-rich supervised task before ﬁne-tuning it again on a data-poor target task. Liu et al. (2019d,c) and\\nBach et al. (2018) get further improvements respectively via multi-task ﬁnetuning and using massive\\namounts of weak supervision. Clark et al. (2019b) demonstrate that knowledge distillation (Hinton\\net al., 2015; Furlanello et al., 2018) can lead to student networks that outperform their teachers.\\nOverall, the quantity and quality of research contributions aimed at the challenges posed by GLUE\\nunderline the utility of this style of benchmark for machine learning researchers looking to evaluate\\nnew application-agnostic methods on language understanding.\\nLimits to current approaches are also apparent via the GLUE suite. Performance on the GLUE\\ndiagnostic entailment dataset, at 0.42 R3, falls far below the average human performance of 0.80\\nR3 reported in the original GLUE publication, with models performing near, or even below, chance\\non some linguistic phenomena (Figure 2, Appendix B). While some initially difﬁcult categories\\nsaw gains from advances on GLUE (e.g., double negation), others remain hard (restrictivity) or\\neven adversarial (disjunction, downward monotonicity). This suggests that even as unsupervised\\npretraining produces ever-better statistical summaries of text, it remains difﬁcult to extract many\\ndetails crucial to semantics without the right kind of supervision. Much recent work has made similar\\nobservations about the limitations of existing pretrained models (Jia and Liang, 2017; Naik et al.,\\n2018; McCoy and Linzen, 2019; McCoy et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a,b).\\n3\\nTable 2: Development set examples from the tasks in SuperGLUE.

To that end, in designing SuperGLUE,\\nwe identify the following desiderata of tasks in the benchmark:\\nTask substance: Tasks should test a system’s ability to understand and reason about texts in English.\\nTask difﬁculty: Tasks should be beyond the scope of current state-of-the-art systems, but solvable by\\nmost college-educated English speakers. We exclude tasks that require domain-speciﬁc knowledge,\\ne.g. medical notes or scientiﬁc papers.\\nEvaluability: Tasks must have an automatic performance metric that corresponds well to human\\njudgments of output quality. Some text generation tasks fail to meet this criteria due to issues with\\nautomatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016, i.a.).\\n4\\nPublic data: We require that tasks have existing public training data in order to minimize the risks\\ninvolved in newly-created datasets. We also prefer tasks for which we have access to (or could create)\\na test set with private labels.\\nTask format: We prefer tasks that had relatively simple input and output formats, to avoid incentiviz-\\ning the users of the benchmark to create complex task-speciﬁc model architectures. Still, while GLUE\\nis restricted to tasks involving single sentence or sentence pair inputs, for SuperGLUE we expand\\nthe scope to consider tasks with longer inputs. This yields a set of tasks that requires understanding\\nindividual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs.\\nLicense: Task data must be available under licences that allow use and redistribution for research\\npurposes.\\nTo identify possible tasks for SuperGLUE, we disseminated a public call for task proposals to the\\nNLP community, and received approximately 30 proposals. We ﬁltered these proposals according\\nto our criteria. Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and\\ninsufﬁcient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining\\ntasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and ﬁltered out tasks which were either\\ntoo challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.\\n3.2\\nSelected Tasks\\nFollowing this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE. See Tables 1 and 2 for details\\nand speciﬁc examples of each task.\\nBoolQ (Boolean Questions, Clark et al., 2019a) is a QA task where each example consists of a short\\npassage and a yes/no question about the passage. The questions are provided anonymously and\\nunsolicited by users of the Google search engine, and afterwards paired with a paragraph from a\\nWikipedia article containing the answer. Following the original work, we evaluate with accuracy.\\nCB (CommitmentBank, de Marneffe et al., 2019) is a corpus of short texts in which at least one\\nsentence contains an embedded clause. Each of these embedded clauses is annotated with the degree\\nto which it appears the person who wrote the text is committed to the truth of the clause. The resulting\\ntask framed as three-class textual entailment on examples that are drawn from the Wall Street Journal,\\nﬁction from the British National Corpus, and Switchboard. Each example consists of a premise\\ncontaining an embedded clause and the corresponding hypothesis is the extraction of that clause.\\nWe use a subset of the data that had inter-annotator agreement above 80%. The data is imbalanced\\n(relatively fewer neutral examples), so we evaluate using accuracy and F1, where for multi-class F1\\nwe compute the unweighted average of the F1 per class.\\nCOPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives, Roemmele et al., 2011) is a causal reasoning task in which\\na system is given a premise sentence and must determine either the cause or effect of the premise\\nfrom two possible choices. All examples are handcrafted and focus on topics from blogs and a\\nphotography-related encyclopedia. Following the original work, we evaluate using accuracy.\\nMultiRC (Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension, Khashabi et al., 2018) is a QA task where each\\nexample consists of a context paragraph, a question about that paragraph, and a list of possible\\nanswers. The system must predict which answers are true and which are false. While many QA\\ntasks exist, we use MultiRC because of a number of desirable properties: (i) each question can have\\nmultiple possible correct answers, so each question-answer pair must be evaluated independent of\\nother pairs, (ii) the questions are designed such that answering each question requires drawing facts\\nfrom multiple context sentences, and (iii) the question-answer pair format more closely matches\\nthe API of other tasks in SuperGLUE than the more popular span-extractive QA format does. The\\nparagraphs are drawn from seven domains including news, ﬁction, and historical text. The evaluation\\nmetrics are F1 over all answer-options (F1a) and exact match of each question’s set of answers (EM).\\nReCoRD (Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning Dataset, Zhang et al., 2018) is a\\nmultiple-choice QA task. Each example consists of a news article and a Cloze-style question about\\nthe article in which one entity is masked out. The system must predict the masked out entity from a\\nlist of possible entities in the provided passage, where the same entity may be expressed with multiple\\ndifferent surface forms, which are all considered correct. Articles are from CNN and Daily Mail. We\\nevaluate with max (over all mentions) token-level F1 and exact match (EM).\\n5\\nRTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment) datasets come from a series of annual competitions on textual\\nentailment. RTE is included in GLUE, and we use the same data and format as GLUE: We merge data\\nfrom RTE1 (Dagan et al., 2006), RTE2 (Bar Haim et al., 2006), RTE3 (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), and\\nRTE5 (Bentivogli et al., 2009). All datasets are combined and converted to two-class classiﬁcation:\\nentailment and not_entailment. Of all the GLUE tasks, RTE is among those that beneﬁts from\\ntransfer learning the most, with performance jumping from near random-chance (∼56%) at the time\\nof GLUE’s launch to 86.3% accuracy (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) at the time of writing.\\nGiven the nearly eight point gap with respect to human performance, however, the task is not yet\\nsolved by machines, and we expect the remaining gap to be difﬁcult to close.\\nWiC (Word-in-Context, Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) is a word sense disambiguation task\\ncast as binary classiﬁcation of sentence pairs. Given two text snippets and a polysemous word that\\nappears in both sentences, the task is to determine whether the word is used with the same sense in\\nboth sentences. Sentences are drawn from WordNet (Miller, 1995), VerbNet (Schuler, 2005), and\\nWiktionary. We follow the original work and evaluate using accuracy.\\nWSC (Winograd Schema Challenge, Levesque et al., 2012) is a coreference resolution task in\\nwhich examples consist of a sentence with a pronoun and a list of noun phrases from the sentence.\\nThe system must determine the correct referrent of the pronoun from among the provided choices.\\nWinograd schemas are designed to require everyday knowledge and commonsense reasoning to solve.\\nGLUE includes a version of WSC recast as NLI, known as WNLI. Until very recently, no substantial\\nprogress had been made on WNLI, with many submissions opting to submit majority class predic-\\ntions.2 In the past few months, several works (Kocijan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019d) have made rapid\\nprogress via a hueristic data augmentation scheme, raising machine performance to 90.4% accuracy.\\nGiven estimated human performance of ∼96%, there is still a gap between machine and human\\nperformance, which we expect will be relatively difﬁcult to close. We therefore include a version of\\nWSC cast as binary classiﬁcation, where each example consists of a sentence with a marked pronoun\\nand noun, and the task is to determine if the pronoun refers to that noun. The training and validation\\nexamples are drawn from the original WSC data (Levesque et al., 2012), as well as those distributed\\nby the afﬁliated organization Commonsense Reasoning.3 The test examples are derived from ﬁction\\nbooks and have been shared with us by the authors of the original dataset. We evaluate using accuracy.\\n3.3\\nScoring\\nAs with GLUE, we seek to give a sense of aggregate system performance over all tasks by averaging\\nscores of all tasks. Lacking a fair criterion with which to weight the contributions of each task to\\nthe overall score, we opt for the simple approach of weighing each task equally, and for tasks with\\nmultiple metrics, ﬁrst averaging those metrics to get a task score.\\n3.4\\nTools for Model Analysis\\nAnalyzing Linguistic and World Knowledge in Models\\nGLUE includes an expert-constructed,\\ndiagnostic dataset that automatically tests models for a broad range of linguistic, commonsense, and\\nworld knowledge. Each example in this broad-coverage diagnostic is a sentence pair labeled with\\na three-way entailment relation (entailment, neutral, or contradiction) and tagged with labels that\\nindicate the phenomena that characterize the relationship between the two sentences. Submissions to\\nthe GLUE leaderboard are required to include predictions from the submission’s MultiNLI classiﬁer\\non the diagnostic dataset, and analyses of the results were shown alongside the main leaderboard.\\nSince this diagnostic task has proved difﬁcult for top models, we retain it in SuperGLUE. However,\\nsince MultiNLI is not part of SuperGLUE, we collapse contradiction and neutral into a single\\nnot_entailment label, and request that submissions include predictions on the resulting set from the\\nmodel used for the RTE task. We estimate human performance following the same procedure we use\\n2WNLI is especially difﬁcult due to an adversarial train/dev split: Premise sentences that appear in the\\ntraining set often appear in the development set with a different hypothesis and a ﬂipped label. If a system\\nmemorizes the training set, which was easy due to the small size of the training set, it could perform far below\\nchance on the development set. We remove this adversarial design in our version of WSC by ensuring that no\\nsentences are shared between the training, validation, and test sets.\\n3http://commonsensereasoning.org/disambiguation.html\\n6\\nfor the benchmark tasks (Section C). We estimate an accuracy of 88% and a Matthew’s correlation\\ncoefﬁcient (MCC, the two-class variant of the R3 metric used in GLUE) of 0.77.\\nAnalyzing Gender Bias in Models\\nRecent work has identiﬁed the presence and ampliﬁcation of\\nmany social biases in data-driven machine learning models (Lu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018, i.a.). To\\npromote the detection of such biases, we include Winogender (Rudinger et al., 2018) as an additional\\ndiagnostic dataset. Winogender is designed to measure gender bias in coreference resolution systems.\\nWe use the Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection (Poliak et al., 2018) version that casts\\nWinogender as a textual entailment task.Each example consists of a premise sentence with a male or\\nfemale pronoun and a hypothesis giving a possible antecedent of the pronoun. Examples occur in\\nminimal pairs, where the only difference between an example and its pair is the gender of the pronoun\\nin the premise. Performance on Winogender is measured with accuracy and the gender parity score:\\nthe percentage of minimal pairs for which the predictions are the same. A system can trivially obtain\\na perfect gender parity score by guessing the same class for all examples, so a high gender parity\\nscore is meaningless unless accompanied by high accuracy. We collect non-expert annotations to\\nestimate human performance, and observe an accuracy of 99.7% and a gender parity score of 0.99.\\nLike any diagnostic, Winogender has limitations. It offers only positive predictive value: A poor\\nbias score is clear evidence that a model exhibits gender bias, but a good score does not mean that\\nthe model is unbiased. More speciﬁcally, in the DNC version of the task, a low gender parity score\\nmeans that a model’s prediction of textual entailment can be changed with a change in pronouns, all\\nelse equal. It is plausible that there are forms of bias that are relevant to target tasks of interest, but\\nthat do not surface in this setting (Gonen and Goldberg, 2019). Also, Winogender does not cover all\\nforms of social bias, or even all forms of gender. For instance, the version of the data used here offers\\nno coverage of gender-neutral they or non-binary pronouns. Despite these limitations, we believe that\\nWinogender’s inclusion is worthwhile in providing a coarse sense of how social biases evolve with\\nmodel performance and for keeping attention on the social ramiﬁcations of NLP models.\\n4\\nUsing SuperGLUE\\nSoftware Tools\\nTo facilitate using SuperGLUE, we release jiant (Wang et al., 2019b),4 a modular\\nsoftware toolkit, built with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017), components from AllenNLP (Gardner\\net al., 2017), and the transformers package.5 jiant implements our baselines and supports the\\nevaluation of custom models and training methods on the benchmark tasks. The toolkit includes\\nsupport for existing popular pretrained models such as OpenAI GPT and BERT, as well as support\\nfor multistage and multitask learning of the kind seen in the strongest models on GLUE.\\nEligibility\\nAny system or method that can produce predictions for the SuperGLUE tasks is eligible\\nfor submission to the leaderboard, subject to the data-use and submission frequency policies stated\\nimmediately below. There are no restrictions on the type of methods that may be used, and there is\\nno requirement that any form of parameter sharing or shared initialization be used across the tasks in\\nthe benchmark. To limit overﬁtting to the private test data, users are limited to a maximum of two\\nsubmissions per day and six submissions per month.\\nData\\nData for the tasks are available for download through the SuperGLUE site and through a\\ndownload script included with the software toolkit. Each task comes with a standardized training set,\\ndevelopment set, and unlabeled test set. Submitted systems may use any public or private data when\\ndeveloping their systems, with a few exceptions: Systems may only use the SuperGLUE-distributed\\nversions of the task datasets, as these use different train/validation/test splits from other public\\nversions in some cases. Systems also may not use the unlabeled test data for the tasks in system\\ndevelopment in any way, may not use the structured source data that was used to collect the WiC\\nlabels (sense-annotated example sentences from WordNet, VerbNet, and Wiktionary) in any way, and\\nmay not build systems that share information across separate test examples in any way.\\nTo ensure reasonable credit assignment, because we build very directly on prior work, we ask the\\nauthors of submitted systems to directly name and cite the speciﬁc datasets that they use, including the\\nbenchmark datasets. We will enforce this as a requirement for papers to be listed on the leaderboard.\\n4https://github.com/nyu-mll/jiant\\n5https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\\n7\\nTable 3: Baseline performance on the SuperGLUE test sets and diagnostics. For CB we report\\naccuracy and macro-average F1. For MultiRC we report F1 on all answer-options and exact match\\nof each question’s set of correct answers. AXb is the broad-coverage diagnostic task, scored using\\nMatthews’ correlation (MCC). AXg is the Winogender diagnostic, scored using accuracy and the\\ngender parity score (GPS). All values are scaled by 100. The Avg column is the overall benchmark\\nscore on non-AX∗tasks. The bolded numbers reﬂect the best machine performance on task. *MultiRC\\nhas multiple test sets released on a staggered schedule, and these results evaluate on an installation of\\nthe test set that is a subset of ours.\\nModel\\nAvg BoolQ\\nCB\\nCOPA\\nMultiRC\\nReCoRD RTE WiC WSC\\nAXb\\nAXg\\nMetrics\\nAcc.\\nF1/Acc.\\nAcc.\\nF1a/EM\\nF1/EM\\nAcc.

Speciﬁcally, we use the bert-large-cased variant.\\nFollowing the practice recommended in Devlin et al. (2019), for each task, we use the simplest\\npossible architecture on top of BERT. We ﬁne-tune a copy of the pretrained BERT model separately\\nfor each task, and leave the development of multi-task learning models to future work. For training,\\nwe use the procedure speciﬁed in Devlin et al. (2019): We use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with an\\ninitial learning rate of 10−5 and ﬁne-tune for a maximum of 10 epochs.\\nFor classiﬁcation tasks with sentence-pair inputs (BoolQ, CB, RTE, WiC), we concatenate the\\nsentences with a [SEP] token, feed the fused input to BERT, and use a logistic regression classiﬁer\\nthat sees the representation corresponding to [CLS]. For WiC, we also concatenate the representation\\nof the marked word. For COPA, MultiRC, and ReCoRD, for each answer choice, we similarly\\nconcatenate the context with that answer choice and feed the resulting sequence into BERT to produce\\nan answer representation. For COPA, we project these representations into a scalar, and take as the\\nanswer the choice with the highest associated scalar. For MultiRC, because each question can have\\nmore than one correct answer, we feed each answer representation into a logistic regression classiﬁer.\\nFor ReCoRD, we also evaluate the probability of each candidate independent of other candidates,\\nand take the most likely candidate as the model’s prediction. For WSC, which is a span-based task,\\nwe use a model inspired by Tenney et al. (2019). Given the BERT representation for each word in the\\noriginal sentence, we get span representations of the pronoun and noun phrase via a self-attention\\nspan-pooling operator (Lee et al., 2017), before feeding it into a logistic regression classiﬁer.\\nBERT++\\nWe also report results using BERT with additional training on related datasets before\\nﬁne-tuning on the benchmark tasks, following the STILTs style of transfer learning (Phang et al.,\\n2018). Given the productive use of MultiNLI in pretraining and intermediate ﬁne-tuning of pretrained\\nlanguage models (Conneau et al., 2017; Phang et al., 2018, i.a.), for CB, RTE, and BoolQ, we use\\nMultiNLI as a transfer task by ﬁrst using the above procedure on MultiNLI. Similarly, given the\\nsimilarity of COPA to SWAG (Zellers et al., 2018), we ﬁrst ﬁne-tune BERT on SWAG. These results\\nare reported as BERT++. For all other tasks, we reuse the results of BERT ﬁne-tuned on just that task.\\nOther Baselines\\nWe include a baseline where for each task we simply predict the majority class,6\\nas well as a bag-of-words baseline where each input is represented as an average of its tokens’ GloVe\\nword vectors (the 300D/840B release from Pennington et al., 2014). Finally, we list the best known\\nresult on each task as of May 2019, except on tasks which we recast (WSC), resplit (CB), or achieve\\n6For ReCoRD, we predict the entity that has the highest F1 with the other entity options.\\n8\\nthe best known result (WiC). The outside results for COPA, MultiRC, and RTE are from Sap et al.\\n(2019), Trivedi et al. (2019), and Liu et al. (2019d) respectively.\\nHuman Performance\\nPilehvar and Camacho-Collados (2019), Khashabi et al. (2018), Nangia and\\nBowman (2019), and Zhang et al. (2018) respectively provide estimates for human performance\\non WiC, MultiRC, RTE, and ReCoRD. For the remaining tasks, including the diagnostic set, we\\nestimate human performance by hiring crowdworker annotators through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk\\nplatform to reannotate a sample of each test set. We follow a two step procedure where a crowd\\nworker completes a short training phase before proceeding to the annotation phase, modeled after the\\nmethod used by Nangia and Bowman (2019) for GLUE. See Appendix C for details.\\n5.2\\nResults\\nTable 3 shows results for all baselines. The most frequent class and CBOW baselines do not perform\\nwell overall, achieving near chance performance for several of the tasks. Using BERT increases\\nthe average SuperGLUE score by 25 points, attaining signiﬁcant gains on all of the benchmark\\ntasks, particularly MultiRC, ReCoRD, and RTE. On WSC, BERT actually performs worse than\\nthe simple baselines, likely due to the small size of the dataset and the lack of data augmentation.\\nUsing MultiNLI as an additional source of supervision for BoolQ, CB, and RTE leads to a 2-5 point\\nimprovement on all tasks. Using SWAG as a transfer task for COPA sees an 8 point improvement.\\nOur best baselines still lag substantially behind human performance. On average, there is a nearly 20\\npoint gap between BERT++ and human performance. The largest gap is on WSC, with a 35 point\\ndifference between the best model and human performance. The smallest margins are on BoolQ,\\nCB, RTE, and WiC, with gaps of around 10 points on each of these. We believe these gaps will be\\nchallenging to close: On WSC and COPA, human performance is perfect. On three other tasks, it is\\nin the mid-to-high 90s. On the diagnostics, all models continue to lag signiﬁcantly behind humans.\\nThough all models obtain near perfect gender parity scores on Winogender, this is due to the fact that\\nthey are obtaining accuracy near that of random guessing.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe present SuperGLUE, a new benchmark for evaluating general-purpose language understanding\\nsystems. SuperGLUE updates the GLUE benchmark by identifying a new set of challenging NLU\\ntasks, as measured by the difference between human and machine baselines. The set of eight tasks in\\nour benchmark emphasizes diverse task formats and low-data training data tasks, with nearly half the\\ntasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\\nWe evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\\nGiven the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer,\\nand unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-\\nformance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed\\nfor work developing new general-purpose machine learning methods for language understanding.\\n7\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank the original authors of the included datasets in SuperGLUE for their cooperation in the\\ncreation of the benchmark, as well as those who proposed tasks and datasets that we ultimately\\ncould not include.

(2019a, see paper for a description of the categories).\\nSome initially difﬁcult categories, like double negation, saw gains from advances on GLUE, but\\nothers remain hard (restrictivity) or even adversarial (disjunction, downward monotone).\\nC\\nHuman Performance Estimation\\nFor collecting data to establish human performance on the SuperGLUE tasks, we follow a two\\nstep procedure where we ﬁrst provide some training to the crowd workers before they proceed to\\nannotation. For both steps and all tasks, the average pay rate is $23.75/hr.7\\nIn the training phase, workers are provided with instructions on the task, linked to an FAQ page, and\\nare asked to annotate up to 30 examples from the development set. After answering each example,\\nworkers are also asked to check their work against the provided ground truth label. After the training\\nphase is complete, we provide the qualiﬁcation to work on the annotation phase to all workers\\nwho annotated a minimum of ﬁve examples, i.e. completed ﬁve HITs during training and achieved\\nperformance at, or above the median performance across all workers during training.\\n7This estimate is taken from https://turkerview.com.\\n16\\nIn the annotation phase, workers are provided with the same instructions as the training phase, and\\nare linked to the same FAQ page. The instructions for all tasks are provided in Appendix C. For the\\nannotation phase we randomly sample 100 examples from the task’s test set, with the exception of\\nWSC where we annotate the full test set. For each example, we collect annotations from ﬁve workers\\nand take a majority vote to estimate human performance. For additional details, see Appendix C.3.\\nC.1\\nTraining Phase Instructions\\nIn the training step, we provide workers with brief instructions about the training phase. An example\\nof these instructions is given Table 5. These training instructions are the same across tasks, only the\\ntask name in the instructions is changed.\\nC.2\\nTask Instructions\\nDuring training and annotation for each task, we provide workers with brief instructions tailored to\\nthe task. We also link workers to an FAQ page for the task. Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9, show the instructions\\nwe used for all four tasks: COPA, CommitmentBank, WSC, and BoolQ respectively. The instructions\\ngiven to crowd workers for annotations on the diagnostic and bias diagnostic datasets are shown in\\nTable 11.\\nWe collected data to produce conservative estimates for human performance on several tasks that we\\ndid not ultimately include in our benchmark, including GAP (Webster et al., 2018), PAWS (Zhang\\net al., 2019), Quora Insincere Questions,8 Ultraﬁne Entity Typing (Choi et al., 2018b), and Empathetic\\nReactions datasets (Buechel et al., 2018). The instructions we used for these tasks are shown in\\nTables 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.\\nC.3\\nTask Speciﬁc Details\\nFor WSC and COPA we provide annotators with a two way classiﬁcation problem. We then use\\nmajority vote across annotations to calculate human performance.\\nCommitmentBank\\nWe follow the authors in providing annotators with a 7-way classiﬁcation\\nproblem. We then collapse the annotations into 3 classes by using the same ranges for bucketing used\\nby de Marneffe et al. (2019). We then use majority vote to get human performance numbers on the\\ntask.\\nFurthermore, for training on CommitmentBank we randomly sample examples from the low inter-\\nannotator agreement portion of the CommitmentBank data that is not included in the benchmark\\nversion of the task. These low agreement examples are generally harder to classify since they are\\nmore ambiguous.\\nDiagnostic Dataset\\nSince the diagnostic dataset does not come with accompanying training data,\\nwe train our workers on examples from RTE’s development set. RTE is also a textual entailment\\ntask and is the most closely related task in the main benchmark. Providing the crowd workers with\\ntraining on RTE enables them to learn label deﬁnitions which should generalize to the diagnostic\\ndataset.\\nUltraﬁne Entity Typing\\nWe cast the task into a binary classiﬁcation problem to make it an easier\\ntask for non-expert crowd workers. We work in cooperation with the authors of the dataset (Choi\\net al., 2018b) to do this reformulation: We give workers one possible tag for a word or phrase and\\nasked them to classify the tag as being applicable or not.\\nThe authors used WordNet (Miller, 1995) to expand the set of labels to include synonyms and\\nhypernyms from WordNet. They then asked ﬁve annotators to validate these tags. The tags from\\nthis validation had high agreement, and were included in the publicly available Ultraﬁne Entity\\nTyping dataset,9 This constitutes our set of positive examples. The rest of the tags from the validation\\nprocedure that are not in the public dataset constitute our negative examples.\\n8https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data\\n9https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~eunsol/open_entity.html\\n17\\nGAP\\nFor the Gendered Ambiguous Pronoun Coreference task (GAP, Webster et al., 2018), we\\nsimpliﬁed the task by providing noun phrase spans as part of the input, thus reducing the original\\nstructure prediction task to a classiﬁcation task. This task was presented to crowd workers as a three\\nway classiﬁcation problem: Choose span A, B, or neither.\\nD\\nExcluded Tasks\\nIn this section we provide some examples of tasks that we evaluated for inclusion but ultimately could\\nnot include. We report on these excluded tasks only with the permission of their authors. We turned\\ndown many medical text datasets because they are usually only accessible with explicit permission\\nand credentials from the data owners.\\nTasks like QuAC (Choi et al., 2018a) and STREUSLE (Schneider and Smith, 2015) differed substan-\\ntially from the format of other tasks in our benchmark, which we worried would incentivize users\\nto spend signiﬁcant effort on task-speciﬁc model designs, rather than focusing on general-purpose\\ntechniques. It was challenging to train annotators to do well on Quora Insincere Questions 10, Empa-\\nthetic Reactions (Buechel et al., 2018), and a recast version of Ultra-Fine Entity Typing (Choi et al.,\\n2018b, see Appendix C.3 for details), leading to low human performance. BERT achieved very high\\nor superhuman performance on Query Well-Formedness (Faruqui and Das, 2018), PAWS (Zhang\\net al., 2019), Discovering Ongoing Conversations (Zanzotto and Ferrone, 2017), and GAP (Webster\\net al., 2018).\\nDuring the process of selecting tasks for our benchmark, we collected human performance baselines\\nand run BERT-based machine baselines for some tasks that we ultimately excluded from our task\\nlist. We chose to exclude these tasks because our BERT baseline performs better than our human\\nperformance baseline or if the gap between human and machine performance is small.\\nOn Quora Insincere Questions our BERT baseline outperforms our human baseline by a small margin:\\nan F1 score of 67.2 versus 66.7 for BERT and human baselines respectively. Similarly, on the\\nEmpathetic Reactions dataset, BERT outperforms our human baseline, where BERT’s predictions\\nhave a Pearson correlation of 0.45 on empathy and 0.55 on distress, compared to 0.45 and 0.35 for\\nour human baseline. For PAWS-Wiki, we report that BERT achieves an accuracy of 91.9%, while our\\nhuman baseline achieved 84% accuracy. These three tasks are excluded from the benchmark since\\nour, admittedly conservative, human baselines are worse than machine performance. Our human\\nperformance baselines are subject to the clarity of our instructions (all instructions can be found in\\nAppendix C), and crowd workers engagement and ability.\\nFor the Query Well-Formedness task, the authors set an estimate human performance at 88.4%\\naccuracy. Our BERT baseline model reaches an accuracy of 82.3%. While there is a positive gap on\\nthis task, the gap was smaller than we were were willing to tolerate. Similarly, on our recast version\\nof the Ultraﬁne Entity Typing, we observe too small a gap between human (60.2 F1) and machine\\nperformance (55.0 F1). Our recasting for this task is described in Appendix C.2. On GAP, when\\ntaken as a classiﬁcation problem without the related task of span selection (details in C.2), BERT\\nperforms (91.0 F1) comparably to our human baseline (94.9 F1). Given this small margin, we also\\nexclude GAP.\\nOn Discovering Ongoing Conversations, our BERT baseline achieves an F1 of 51.9 on a version of\\nthe task cast as sentence pair classiﬁcation (given two snippets of texts from plays, determine if the\\nsecond snippet is a continuation of the ﬁrst). This dataset is very class imbalanced (90% negative), so\\nwe also experimented with a class-balanced version on which our BERT baselines achieves 88.4\\nF1. Qualitatively, we also found the task challenging for humans as there was little context for the\\ntext snippets and the examples were drawn from plays using early English. Given this fairly high\\nmachine performance and challenging nature for humans, we exclude this task from our benchmark.\\nInstructions tables begin on the following page.\\n10https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data\\n18\\nTable 5: The instructions given to crowd-sourced worker describing the training phase for the Choice\\nof Plausible Answers (COPA) task.\\nThe New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research\\non computer understanding of English.

These instructions were provided during\\nboth training and annotation phases.\\nSpeaker Commitment Instructions\\nThe New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research\\non computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\\nWe will present you with a prompt taken from a piece of dialogue, this could be a single sentence,\\na few sentences, or a short exchange between people. Your job is to ﬁgure out, based on this\\nﬁrst prompt (on top), how certain the speaker is about the truthfulness of the second prompt\\n(on the bottom). You can choose from a 7 point scale ranging from (1) completely certain that\\nthe second prompt is true to (7) completely certain that the second prompt is false. Here are\\nexamples for a few of the labels:\\nChoose 1 (certain that it is true) if the speaker from the ﬁrst prompt deﬁnitely believes or knows\\nthat the second prompt is true. For example,\\n\"What fun to hear Artemis laugh. She’s such a serious child. I didn’t know\\nshe had a sense of humor.\"\\n\"Artemis had a sense of humor\"\\nChoose 4 (not certain if it is true or false) if the speaker from the ﬁrst prompt is uncertain if the\\nsecond prompt is true or false. For example,\\n\"Tess is committed to track. She’s always trained with all her heart and soul.\\nOne can only hope that she has recovered from the ﬂu and will cross the ﬁnish\\nline.\"\\n\"Tess crossed the ﬁnish line.\"\\nChoose 7 (certain that it is false) if the speaker from the ﬁrst prompt deﬁnitely believes or knows\\nthat the second prompt is false. For example,\\n\"Did you hear about Olivia’s chemistry test? She studied really hard. But\\neven after putting in all that time and energy, she didn’t manage to pass the\\ntest\".\\n\"Olivia passed the test.\"\\nIf you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\\n20\\nTable 8: Task-speciﬁc instructions for Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC).

The season premiered on September 27,\\n2017 in a new time slot at 10:00PM on Wednesday when it had previously\\nbeen at 9:00PM on Wednesday since its inception. The season concluded on\\nApril 18, 2018 with a two-part season ﬁnale.\\nwill there be a 13th season of criminal minds?\\n(In the above example, the ﬁrst line of the passage says that the 13th season of\\nthe show was ordered.)\\nAs of 8 August 2016, the FDA extended its regulatory power to include e-\\ncigarettes. Under this ruling the FDA will evaluate certain issues, including\\ningredients, product features and health risks, as well their appeal to minors\\nand non-users. The FDA rule also bans access to minors. A photo ID is\\nrequired to buy e-cigarettes, and their sale in all-ages vending machines is not\\npermitted. The FDA in September 2016 has sent warning letters for unlawful\\nunderage sales to online retailers and retailers of e-cigarettes.\\nis vaping illegal if you are under 18?\\n(In the above example, the passage states that the \"FDA rule also bans access\\nto minors.\" The question uses the word \"vaping,\" which is a synonym for\\ne-cigrattes.)\\nIn the following examples the correct answer is No,\\nBadgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also\\nincludes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the\\ncaniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are\\ngrouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the\\nhoney badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic\\nstink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae\\n(and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually\\nmembers of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.\\nis a wolverine the same as a badger?\\n(In the above example, the passage says that badgers and wolverines are in\\nthe same family, Mustelidae, which does not mean they are the same animal.)\\n22\\nTable 10: Continuation from Table 9 of task-speciﬁc instructions for BoolQ.

For example,\\n• \"Murphy recently decided to move to London.\"\\n\"Murphy recently decided to move to England.\"\\n(The above example is True because London is in England and therefore prompt 2 is\\nclearly implied by prompt 1.)\\n• \"Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov set the record for the longest continuous amount\\nof time spent in space, a staggering 438 days, between 1994 and 1995.\"\\n\"Russians hold record for longest stay in space.\"\\n(The above example is True because the information in the second prompt is contained\\nin the ﬁrst prompt: Valery is Russian and she set the record for longest stay in space.)\\n• \"She does not disgree with her brother’s opinion, but she believes he’s too aggresive in\\nhis defense\"\\n\"She agrees with her brother’s opinion, but she believes he’s too aggresive in his\\ndefense\"\\n(The above example is True because the second prompt is an exact paraphrase of the\\nﬁrst prompt, with exactly the same meaning.)\\nChoose False if the event or situation described with the ﬁrst prompt on top does not necessarily\\nimply that this second prompt must also be true. For example,\\n• \"This method was developed at Columbia and applied to data processing at CERN.\"\\n\"This method was developed at Columbia and applied to data processing at CERN\\nwith limited success.\"\\n(The above example is False because the second prompt is introducing new information\\nnot implied in the ﬁrst prompt: The ﬁrst prompt does not give us any knowledge of\\nhow succesful the application of the method at CERN was.)\\n• \"This building is very tall.\"\\n\"This is the tallest building in New York.\"\\n(The above example is False because a building being tall does not mean it must be the\\ntallest building, nor that it is in New York.)\\n• \"Hours earlier, Yasser Arafat called for an end to attacks against Israeli civilians in\\nthe two weeks before Israeli elections.\"\\n\"Arafat condemned suicide bomb attacks inside Israel.\"\\n(The above example is False because from the ﬁrst prompt we only know that Arafat\\ncalled for an end to attacks against Israeli citizens, we do not know what kind of attacks\\nhe may have been condemning.)\\nYou do not have to worry about whether the writing style is maintained between the two prompts.\\nIf you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\\n24\\nTable 12: Task-speciﬁc instructions for the Gendered Ambiguous Pronoun Coreference (GAP) task.\\nThese instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\\nGAP Instructions\\nThe New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research\\non computer understanding of English.

We demon-\\nstrate that this embedding is capable of predicting task sim-\\nilarities that match our intuition about semantic and tax-\\nonomic relations between different visual tasks (e.g., tasks\\nbased on classifying different types of plants are similar).\\nWe also demonstrate the practical value of this framework\\nfor the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor\\nfor a new task. We present a simple meta-learning frame-\\nwork for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of\\npredicting which feature extractors will perform well. Se-\\nlecting a feature extractor with task embedding obtains a\\nperformance close to the best available feature extractor,\\nwhile costing substantially less than exhaustively training\\nand evaluating on all available feature extractors.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\\ntasks.\\nYet, no general framework exists to describe and\\nlearn relations between tasks. We introduce the TASK2VEC\\nembedding, a technique to represent tasks as elements of a\\nvector space based on the Fisher Information Matrix. The\\nnorm of the embedding correlates with the complexity of\\nthe task, while the distance between embeddings captures\\nsemantic similarities between tasks (Fig. 1). When other\\nnatural distances are available, such as the taxonomical dis-\\ntance in biological classiﬁcation, we ﬁnd that the embed-\\nding distance correlates positively with it (Fig. 2). More-\\nover, we introduce an asymmetric distance on tasks which\\ncorrelates with the transferability between tasks.\\nComputation of the embedding leverages a duality be-\\ntween network parameters (weights) and outputs (activa-\\ntions) in a deep neural network (DNN): Just as the activa-\\ntions of a DNN trained on a complex visual recognition task\\nare a rich representation of the input images, we show that\\nthe gradients of the weights relative to a task-speciﬁc loss\\nare a rich representation of the task itself. Speciﬁcally, given\\na task deﬁned by a dataset D = {(xi, yi)}N\\ni=1 of labeled\\nsamples, we feed the data through a pre-trained reference\\nconvolutional neural network which we call “probe net-\\nwork”, and compute the diagonal Fisher Information Ma-\\ntrix (FIM) of the network ﬁlter parameters to capture the\\nstructure of the task (Sect. 2). Since the architecture and\\nweights of the probe network are ﬁxed, the FIM provides a\\nﬁxed-dimensional representation of the task. We show this\\nembedding encodes the “difﬁculty” of the task, character-\\nistics of the input domain, and which features of the probe\\nnetwork are useful to solve it (Sect. 2.1).\\nOur task embedding can be used to reason about the\\nspace of tasks and solve meta-tasks. As a motivating exam-\\nple, we study the problem of selecting the best pre-trained\\nfeature extractor to solve a new task. This can be particu-\\nlarly valuable when there is insufﬁcient data to train or ﬁne-\\ntune a generic model, and transfer of knowledge is essen-\\ntial.\\nTASK2VEC depends solely on the task, and ignores\\ninteractions with the model which may however play an\\nimportant role. To address this, we learn a joint task and\\nmodel embedding, called MODEL2VEC, in such a way that\\nmodels whose embeddings are close to a task exhibit good\\nperfmormance on the task. We use this to select an expert\\nfrom a given collection, improving performance relative to\\n1\\narXiv:1902.03545v1  [cs.LG]  10 Feb 2019\\nTask Embeddings\\nDomain Embeddings\\nActinopterygii (n)\\nAmphibia (n)\\nArachnida (n)\\nAves (n)\\nFungi (n)\\nInsecta (n)\\nMammalia (n)\\nMollusca (n)\\nPlantae (n)\\nProtozoa (n)\\nReptilia (n)\\nCategory (m)\\nColor (m)\\nGender (m)\\nMaterial (m)\\nNeckline (m)\\nPants (m)\\nPattern (m)\\nShoes (m)\\nFigure 1: Task embedding across a large library of tasks (best seen magniﬁed).

We discuss\\nour contribution in relation to prior literature in Sect. 6, after\\npresenting our empirical results in Sect. 5.\\n2. Task Embeddings via Fisher Information\\nGiven an observed input x (e.g., an image) and an hid-\\nden task variable y (e.g., a label), a deep network is a\\nfamily of functions pw(y|x) parametrized by weights w,\\ntrained to approximate the posterior p(y|x) by minimizing\\nthe (possibly regularized) cross entropy loss Hpw,ˆp(y|x) =\\nEx,y∼ˆp[−log pw(y|x)], where ˆp is the empirical distribu-\\ntion deﬁned by the training set D = {(xi, yi)}N\\ni=1. It is\\nuseful, especially in transfer learning, to think of the net-\\nwork as composed of two parts: a feature extractor which\\ncomputes some representation z = φw(x) of the input data,\\nand a “head,” or classiﬁer, which encodes the distribution\\np(y|z) given the representation z.\\nNot all network weights are equally useful in predicting\\nthe task variable: the importance, or “informative content,”\\nof a weight for the task can be quantiﬁed by considering a\\nperturbation w′ = w + δw of the weights, and measuring\\nthe average Kullbach-Leibler (KL) divergence between the\\noriginal output distribution pw(y|x) and the perturbed one\\npw′(y|x). To second-order approximation, this is\\nEx∼ˆp KL(pw′(y|x) ∥pw(y|x)) = δw · Fδw + o(δw2),\\nwhere F is the Fisher information matrix (FIM):\\nF = Ex,y∼ˆp(x)pw(y|x)\\n\\x02\\n∇w log pw(y|x)∇w log pw(y|x)T \\x03\\n.\\nthat is, the expected covariance of the scores (gradients of\\nthe log-likelihood) with respect to the model parameters.\\nThe FIM is a Riemannian metric on the space of proba-\\nbility distributions [7], and provides a measure of the infor-\\nmation a particular parameter (weight or feature) contains\\nabout the joint distribution pw(x, y) = ˆp(x)pw(y|x): If the\\nclassiﬁcation performance for a given task does not depend\\nstrongly a parameter, the corresponding entry in the FIM\\nwill be small. The FIM is also related to the (Kolmogorov)\\ncomplexity of a task, a property that can be used to de-\\nﬁne a computable metric of the learning distance between\\ntasks [3]. Finally, the FIM can be interpreted as an easy-to-\\ncompute positive semideﬁnite upper-bound to the Hessian\\nof the cross-entropy loss, and coincides with it at local min-\\nima [24]. In particular, “ﬂat minima” correspond to weights\\nthat have, on average, low (Fisher) information [5, 13].\\n2.1. TASK2VEC embedding using a probe network\\nWhile the network activations capture the information in\\nthe input image which are needed to infer the image label,\\nthe FIM indicates the set of feature maps which are more\\ninformative for solving the current task. Following this in-\\ntuition, we use the FIM to represent the task itself. How-\\never, the FIMs computed on different networks are not di-\\nrectly comparable. To address this, we use single “probe”\\nnetwork pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor and\\nre-train only the classiﬁer layer on any given task, which\\nusually can be done efﬁciently. After training is complete,\\nwe compute the FIM for the feature extractor parameters.\\nSince the full FIM is unmanageably large for rich probe\\nnetworks based on CNNs, we make two additional approxi-\\nmations. First, we only consider the diagonal entries, which\\nimplicitly assumes that correlations between different ﬁlters\\nin the probe network are not important. Second, since the\\nweights in each ﬁlter are usually not independent, we aver-\\nage the Fisher Information for all weights in the same ﬁlter.\\nThe resulting representation thus has ﬁxed size, equal to the\\nnumber of ﬁlters in the probe network. We call this embed-\\nding method TASK2VEC.\\nRobust Fisher computation\\nSince the FIM is a local\\nquantity, it is affected by the local geometry of the training\\nloss landscape, which is highly irregular in many deep net-\\nwork architectures [21], and may be too noisy when trained\\nwith few samples. To avoid this problem, instead of a direct\\ncomputation, we use a more robust estimator that leverages\\nconnections to variational inference. Assume we perturb\\nthe weights ˆw of the network with Gaussian noise N(0, Λ)\\nwith precision matrix Λ, and we want to ﬁnd the optimal Λ\\nwhich yields a good expected error, while remaining close\\nto an isotropic prior N( ˆw, λ2I). That is, we want to ﬁnd Λ\\nthat minimizes:\\nL( ˆw; Λ) = Ew∼N ( ˆ\\nw,Λ)[Hpw,ˆpp(y|x)]\\n+ β KL(N(0, Λ) ∥N(0, λ2I)),\\nwhere H is the cross-entropy loss and β controls the weight\\nof the prior. Notice that for β = 1 this reduces to the Evi-\\ndence Lower-Bound (ELBO) commonly used in variational\\ninference. Approximating to the second order, the optimal\\nvalue of Λ satisﬁes (see Supplementary Material):\\nβ\\n2N Λ = F + βλ2\\n2N I.\\nTherefore,\\nβ\\n2N Λ ∼F +o(1) can be considered as an estima-\\ntor of the FIM F, biased towards the prior λ2I in the low-\\ndata regime instead of being degenerate. In case the task is\\ntrivial (the loss is constant or there are too few samples) the\\nembedding will coincide with the prior λ2I, which we will\\nrefer to as the trivial embedding. This estimator has the\\nadvantage of being easy to compute by directly minimizing\\nthe loss L( ˆw; Σ) through Stochastic Gradient Variational\\nBayes [18], while being less sensitive to irregularities of\\nthe loss landscape than direct computation, since the value\\nof the loss depends on the cross-entropy in a neighborhood\\nof ˆw of size Λ−1. As in the standard Fisher computation,\\nwe estimate one parameter per ﬁlter, rather than per weight,\\nwhich in practice means that we constrain Λii = Λjj when-\\never wi and wj belongs to the same ﬁlter. In this case, opti-\\nmization of L( ˆw; Λ) can be done efﬁciently using the local\\nreparametrization trick of [18].\\n2.2. Properties of the TASK2VEC embedding\\nThe task embedding we just deﬁned has a number of\\nuseful properties. For illustrative purposes, consider a two-\\nlayer sigmoidal network for which an analytic expression\\ncan be derived (see Supplementary Materials). The FIM\\nof the feature extractor parameters can be written using the\\nKronecker product as\\nF = Ex,y∼ˆp(x)pw(y|x)[(y −p)2 · S ⊗xxT ]\\nwhere p = pw(y = 1|x) and the matrix S = wwT ⊙zzT ⊙\\n(1 −z)(1 −z)T is an element-wise product of classiﬁer\\nweights w and ﬁrst layer feature activations z. It is informa-\\ntive to compare this expression to an embedding based only\\non the dataset domain statistics, such as the (non-centered)\\ncovariance C0 = E\\n\\x02\\nxxT \\x03\\nof the input data or the covari-\\nance C1 = E\\n\\x02\\nzzT \\x03\\nof the feature activations. One could\\ntake such statistics as a representative domain embedding\\nsince they only depend on the marginal distribution p(x) in\\ncontrast to the FIM task embedding, which depends on the\\njoint distribution p(x, y). These simple expressions high-\\nlight some important (and more general) properties of the\\nFisher embedding we now describe.\\nInvariance to the label space: The task embedding does\\nnot directly depend on the task labels, but only on the pre-\\ndicted distribution pw(y|x) of the trained model.\\nInfor-\\nmation about the ground-truth labels y is encoded in the\\nweights w which are a sufﬁcient statistic of the task [5]. In\\nparticular, the task embedding is invariant to permutations\\nof the labels y, and has ﬁxed dimension (number of ﬁlters\\nof the feature extractor) regardless of the output space (e.g.,\\nk-way classiﬁcation with varying k).\\nEncoding task difﬁculty: As we can see from the ex-\\npressions above, if the ﬁt model is very conﬁdent in its pre-\\ndictions, E[(y −p)2] goes to zero. Hence, the norm of the\\ntask embedding ∥F∥⋆scales with the difﬁculty of the task\\nfor a given feature extractor φ. Figure 2 (Right) shows that\\neven for more complex models trained on real data, the FIM\\nnorm correlates with test performance.\\nEncoding task domain: Data points x that are classi-\\nﬁed with high conﬁdence, i.e., p is close to 0 or 1, will\\nhave a lower contribution to the task embedding than points\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\n125\\nSize k of neighborhood\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\n3.0\\nAvg. top-k tax. distance\\nTask2Vec distance\\nTax. distance\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\nL1 norm of task embedding 1e8\\n0%\\n10%\\n20%\\n30%\\n40%\\n50%\\n60%\\nTest error on task (%)\\nFigure 2: Distance between species classiﬁcation tasks.\\n(Left) Task similarity matrix ordered by hierarchical clustering.\\nNote that the dendrogram produced by the task similarity matches the taxonomic clusters (indicated by color bar). (Center)\\nFor tasks extracted from iNaturalist and CUB, we compare the cosine distance between tasks to their taxonomical distance.\\nAs the size of the task embedding neighborhood increases (measured by number of tasks in the neighborhood), we plot the\\naverage taxonomical distance of tasks from the neighborhood center. While the task distance does not perfectly match the\\ntaxonomical distance (whose curve is shown in orange), it shows a good correlation. Difference are both due to the fact that\\ntaxonomically close species may need very different features to be classiﬁed, creating a mismatch between the two notions\\nof distance, and because for some tasks in iNaturalist too few samples are provided to compute a good embedding.

Compare this to the covariance matrix of the data,\\nC0, to which all data points contribute equally. Instead, in\\nTASK2VEC information on the domain is based on data near\\nthe decision boundary (task-weighted domain embedding).\\nEncoding useful features for the task: The FIM de-\\npends on the curvature of the loss function with the diagonal\\nentries capturing the sensitivity of the loss to model param-\\neters. Speciﬁcally, in the two-layer model one can see that,\\nif a given feature is uncorrelated with y, the correspond-\\ning blocks of F are zero. In contrast, a domain embedding\\nbased on feature activations of the probe network (e.g., C1)\\nonly reﬂects which features vary over the dataset without\\nindication of whether they are relevant to the task.\\n3. Similarity Measures on the Space of Tasks\\nWhat metric should be used on the space of tasks? This\\ndepends critically on the meta-task we are considering. As a\\nmotivation, we concentrate on the meta-task of selecting the\\npre-trained feature extractor from a set in order to obtain the\\nbest performance on a new training task. There are several\\nnatural metrics that may be considered for this meta-task.\\nIn this work, we mainly consider:\\nTaxonomic distance\\nFor some tasks, there is a natural no-\\ntion of semantic similarity, for instance deﬁned by sets of\\ncategories organized in a taxonomic hierarchy where each\\ntask is classiﬁcation inside a subtree of the hierarchy (e.g.,\\nwe may say that classifying breeds of dogs is closer to clas-\\nsiﬁcation of cats than it is to classiﬁcation of species of\\nplants). In this setting, we can deﬁne\\nDtax(ta, tb) =\\nmin\\ni∈Sa,j∈Sb d(i, j),\\nwhere Sa, Sb are the sets of categories in task ta, tb and\\nd(i, j) is an ultrametric or graph distance in the taxonomy\\ntree. Notice that this is a proper distance, and in particular\\nit is symmetric.\\nTransfer distance.\\nWe deﬁne the transfer (or ﬁne-tuning)\\ngain from a task ta to a task tb (which we improperly call\\ndistance, but is not necessarily symmetric or positive) as\\nthe difference in expected performance between a model\\ntrained for task tb from a ﬁxed initialization (random or pre-\\ntrained), and the performance of a model ﬁne-tuned for task\\ntb starting from a solution of task ta:\\nDft(ta →tb) = E[ℓa→b] −E[ℓb]\\nE[ℓb]\\n,\\nwhere the expectations are taken over all trainings with the\\nselected architecture, training procedure and network ini-\\ntialization, ℓb is the ﬁnal test error obtained by training on\\ntask b from the chosen initialization, and ℓa→b is the error\\nobtained instead when starting from a solution to task a and\\nthen ﬁne-tuning (with the selected procedure) on task tb.\\n3.1. Symmetric and asymmetric TASK2VEC metrics\\nBy construction,\\nthe Fisher embedding on which\\nTASK2VEC is based captures fundamental information\\nabout the structure of the task. We may therefore expect\\nthat the distance between two embeddings correlate posi-\\ntively with natural metrics on the space of tasks. However,\\nthere are two problems in using the Euclidean distance be-\\ntween embeddings: the parameters of the network have dif-\\nferent scales, and the norm of the embedding is affected by\\ncomplexity of the task and the number of samples used to\\ncompute the embedding.\\nSymmetric TASK2VEC distance\\nTo make the distance\\ncomputation robust, we propose to use the cosine distance\\nbetween normalized embeddings:\\ndsym(Fa, Fb) = dcos\\n\\x10\\nFa\\nFa + Fb\\n,\\nFb\\nFa + Fb\\n\\x11\\n,\\nwhere dcos is the cosine distance, Fa and Fb are the two\\ntask embeddings (i.e., the diagonal of the Fisher Informa-\\ntion computed on the same probe network), and the division\\nis element-wise. This is a symmetric distance which we ex-\\npect to capture semantic similarity between two tasks. For\\nexample, we show in Fig. 2 that it correlates well with the\\ntaxonomical distance between species on iNaturalist.\\nOn the other hand, precisely for this reason, this distance\\nis ill-suited for tasks such as model selection, where the (in-\\ntrinsically asymmetric) transfer distance is more relevant.\\nAsymmetric TASK2VEC distance\\nIn a ﬁrst approxima-\\ntion, that does not consider either the model or the training\\nprocedure used, positive transfer between two tasks depends\\nboth on the similarity between two tasks and on the com-\\nplexity of the ﬁrst. Indeed, pre-training on a general but\\ncomplex task such as ImageNet often yields a better result\\nthan ﬁne-tuning from a close dataset of comparable com-\\nplexity. In our case, complexity can be measured as the dis-\\ntance from the trivial embedding. This suggests the follow-\\ning asymmetric score, again improperly called a “distance”\\ndespite being asymmetric and possibly negative:\\ndasym(ta →tb) = dsym(ta, tb) −αdsym(ta, t0),\\nwhere t0 is the trivial embedding, and α is an hyperparam-\\neter.\\nThis has the effect of bring more complex models\\ncloser. The hyper-parameter α can be selected based on\\nthe meta-task. In our experiments, we found that the best\\nvalue of α (α = 0.15 when using a ResNet-34 pretrained\\non ImageNet as the probe network) is robust to the choice\\nof meta-tasks.\\n4. MODEL2VEC: task/model co-embedding\\nBy construction, the TASK2VEC distance ignores details\\nof the model and only relies on the task. If we know what\\ntask a model was trained on, we can represent the model by\\nthe embedding of that task. However, in general we may\\nnot have such information (e.g., black-box models or hand-\\nconstructed feature extractors). We may also have multiple\\nmodels trained on the same task with different performance\\ncharacteristics. To model the joint interaction between task\\nand model (i.e., architecture and training algorithm), we aim\\nto learn a joint embedding of the two.\\nWe consider for concreteness the problem of learning\\na joint embedding for model selection.\\nIn order to em-\\nbed models in the task space so that those near a task\\nare likely to perform well on that task, we formulate the\\nfollowing meta-learning problem: Given k models, their\\nMODEL2VEC embedding are the vectors mi = Fi + bi,\\nwhere Fi is the task embedding of the task used to train\\nmodel mi (if available, else we set it to zero), and bi is a\\nlearned “model bias” that perturbs the task embedding to\\naccount for particularities of the model. We learn bi by opti-\\nmizing a k-way cross entropy loss to predict the best model\\ngiven the task distance (see Supplementary Material):\\nL = E[−log p(m | dasym(t, m0), . . . , dasym(t, mk))].\\nAfter training, given a novel query task t, we can then pre-\\ndict the best model for it as the arg maxi dasym(t, mi), that\\nis, the model mi embedded closest to the query task.\\n5. Experiments\\nWe test TASK2VEC on a large collection of tasks and\\nmodels, related to different degrees. Our experiments aim to\\ntest both qualitative properties of the embedding and its per-\\nformance on meta-learning tasks. We use an off-the-shelf\\nResNet-34 pretrained on ImageNet as our probe network,\\nwhich we found to give the best overall performance (see\\nSect. 5.2). The collection of tasks is generated starting\\nfrom the following four main datasets. iNaturalist [36]:\\nEach task extracted corresponds to species classiﬁcation in\\na given taxonomical order.\\nFor instance, the “Rodentia\\ntask” is to classify species of rodents.\\nNotice that each\\ntask is deﬁned on a separate subset of the images in the\\noriginal dataset; that is, the domains of the tasks are dis-\\njoint. CUB-200 [37]: We use the same procedure as iNat-\\nuralist to create tasks. In this case, all tasks are classiﬁca-\\ntions inside orders of birds (the aves taxonomical class), and\\nhave generally much less training samples than correspond-\\ning tasks in iNaturalist. iMaterialist [1] and DeepFashion\\n[23]: Each image in both datasets is associated with sev-\\neral binary attributes (e.g., style attributes) and categorical\\nattributes (e.g., color, type of dress, material). We binarize\\nthe categorical attributes, and consider each attribute as a\\nseparate task. Notice that, in this case, all tasks share the\\nsame domain and are naturally correlated.\\nIn total, our collection of tasks has 1460 tasks (207\\niNaturalist, 25 CUB, 228 iMaterialist, 1000 DeepFashion).\\nWhile a few tasks have many training examples (e.g., hun-\\ndred thousands), most have just hundreds or thousands of\\nsamples. This simulates the heavy-tail distribution of data\\nin real-world applications.\\n[CUB] Bombycillidae\\n[CUB] Thraupidae\\n[CUB] Laniidae\\n[CUB] Passeridae\\n[CUB] Mimidae\\n[CUB] Anseriformes\\n[CUB] Fringillidae\\n[CUB] Cardinalidae\\n[CUB] Caprimulgiformes\\n[CUB] Procellariiformes\\n[CUB] Apodiformes\\n[CUB] Hirundinidae\\n[CUB] Cuculiformes\\n[CUB] Coraciiformes\\n[CUB] Podicipediformes\\n[CUB] Pelecaniformes\\n[CUB] Piciformes\\n[CUB] Corvidae\\n[CUB] Icteridae\\n[CUB] Troglodytidae\\n[CUB] Tyrannidae\\n[CUB] Vireonidae\\n[CUB] Charadriiformes\\n[CUB] Parulidae\\n[CUB] Emberizidae\\n[iNat] Pelecaniformes\\n[iNat] Rodentia\\n[iNat] Columbiformes\\n[iNat] Sapindales\\n[iNat] Piciformes\\n[iNat] Accipitriformes\\n[iNat] Ranunculales\\n[iNat] Anseriformes\\n[iNat] Coleoptera\\n[iNat] Carnivora\\n[iNat] Anura\\n[iNat] Charadriiformes\\n[iNat] Gentianales\\n[iNat] Ericales\\n[iNat] Asparagales\\n[iNat] Fabales\\n[iNat] Asterales\\n[iNat] Odonata\\n[iNat] Rosales\\n[iNat] Passeriformes\\n[iNat] Caryophyllales\\n[iNat] Perciformes\\n[iNat] Squamata\\n[iNat] Lamiales\\n[iNat] Lepidoptera\\n0%\\n20%\\n40%\\n60%\\n80%\\nTest Error\\niNat+CUB error distribution and expert selection\\nSelected expert\\nImageNet expert\\nFigure 3: TASK2VEC often selects the best available experts. Violin plot of the distribution of the ﬁnal test error (shaded\\nplot) on tasks from the CUB-200 dataset (columns) obtained by training a linear classiﬁer over several expert feature extrac-\\ntors (points). Most specialized feature extractors perform similarly on a given task, and generally are similar or worse than a\\ngeneric feature extractor pre-trained on ImageNet (blue triangles). However, in some cases a carefully chosen expert, trained\\non a relevant task, can greatly outperform all other experts (long whisker of the violin plot). The model selection algorithm\\nbased on TASK2VEC can, without training, suggest an expert to use for the task (red cross, lower is better). TASK2VEC mostly\\nrecover the optimal, or close to optimal, feature extractor to use without having to perform an expensive brute-force search\\nover all possibilities. Columns are ordered by norm of the task embedding: Notice tasks with lower embedding norm have\\nlower error and more “complex” task (task with higher embedding norm) tend to beneﬁt more from a specialized expert.\\nTogether with the collection of tasks, we collect several\\n“expert” feature extractors. These are ResNet-34 models\\npre-trained on ImageNet and then ﬁne-tuned on a speciﬁc\\ntask or collection of related tasks (see Supplementary Ma-\\nterials for details). We also consider a “generic”expert pre-\\ntrained on ImageNet without any ﬁnetuning. Finally, for\\neach combination of expert feature extractor and task, we\\ntrained a linear classiﬁer on top of the expert in order to\\nsolve the selected task using the expert.\\nIn total, we trained 4,100 classiﬁers, 156 feature extrac-\\ntors and 1,460 embeddings. The total effort to generate the\\nﬁnal results was about 1,300 GPU hours.\\nMeta-tasks.\\nIn Sect. 5.2, for a given task we aim to pre-\\ndict, using TASK2VEC , which expert feature extractor will\\nyield the best classiﬁcation performance. In particular, we\\nformulate two model selection meta-tasks: iNat + CUB and\\nMixed. The ﬁrst consists of 50 tasks and experts from iNat-\\nuralist and CUB, and aims to test ﬁne-grained expert selec-\\ntion in a restricted domain. The second contains a mix of\\n26 curated experts and 50 random tasks extracted from all\\ndatasets, and aims to test model selection between different\\ndomains and tasks (see Supplementary Material for details).\\n5.1. Task Embedding Results\\nTask Embedding qualitatively reﬂects taxonomic dis-\\ntance for iNaturalist\\nFor tasks extracted from the iNat-\\nuralist dataset (classiﬁcation of species), the taxonomical\\ndistance between orders provides a natural metric of the se-\\nmantic similarity between tasks. In Figure 2 we compare\\nthe symmetric TASK2VEC distance with the taxonomical\\ndistance, showing strong agreement.\\nTask embedding for iMaterialist\\nIn Fig. 1 we show a\\nt-SNE visualization of the embedding for iMaterialist and\\niNaturalist tasks. Task embedding yields interpretable re-\\nsults: Tasks that are correlated in the dataset, such as binary\\nclasses corresponding to the same categorical attribute, may\\nend up far away from each other and close to other tasks that\\nare semantically more similar (e.g., the jeans category task\\nis close to the ripped attribute and the denim material). This\\nis reﬂected in the mixture of colors of semantically related\\nnearby tasks, showing non-trivial grouping.\\nWe also compare the TASK2VEC embedding with a do-\\nmain embedding baseline, which only exploits the input\\ndistribution p(x) rather than the task distribution p(x, y).\\nWhile some tasks are highly correlated with their domain\\n(e.g., tasks from iNaturalist), other tasks differ only on the\\nlabels (e.g., all the attribute tasks of iMaterialist, which\\nshare the same clothes domain).

As shown\\nanalytically for the two-layers model, the norm of the task\\nembedding correlates with the complexity of the task also\\non real tasks and architectures.\\n5.2. Model Selection\\nGiven a task, our aim is to select an expert feature extrac-\\ntor that maximizes the classiﬁcation performance on that\\ntask. We propose two strategies: (1) embed the task and\\nselect the feature extractor trained on the most similar task,\\nand (2) jointly embed the models and tasks, and select a\\nmodel using the learned metric (see Section 4). Notice that\\n(1) does not use knowledge of the model performance on\\nvarious tasks, which makes it more widely applicable but\\nrequires we know what task a model was trained for and\\nmay ignore the fact that models trained on slightly differ-\\nent tasks may still provide an overall better feature extrac-\\ntor (for example by over-ﬁtting less to the task they were\\ntrained on).\\nIn Table 2 we compare the overall results of the various\\nproposed metrics on the model selection meta-tasks. On\\nboth the iNat+CUB and Mixed meta-tasks, the Asymmetric\\nTASK2VEC model selection is close to the ground-truth op-\\ntimal, and signiﬁcantly improves over both chance, and over\\nusing an generic ImageNet expert. Notice that our method\\nhas O(1) complexity, while searching over a collection of\\nN experts is O(N).\\nError distribution\\nIn Fig. 3 we show in detail the error\\ndistribution of the experts on multiple tasks. It is interesting\\nto notice that the classiﬁcation error obtained using most ex-\\nperts clusters around some mean value, and little improve-\\nment is observed over using a generic expert. On the other\\nhand, a few optimal experts can obtain a largely better per-\\nformance on the task than a generic expert. This conﬁrms\\nthe importance of having access to a large collection of ex-\\nperts when solving a new task, especially if few training\\ndata are available. But this collection can only be efﬁciently\\nexploited if an algorithm is given to efﬁciently ﬁnd one of\\nthe few experts for the task, which we propose.\\nDependence on task dataset size\\nFinding experts is es-\\npecially important when the task we are interested in has\\nrelatively few samples. In Fig. 4 we show how the perfor-\\nmance of TASK2VEC varies on a model selection task as the\\nnumber of samples varies. At all sample sizes TASK2VEC is\\nclose to the optimum, and improves over selecting a generic\\nexpert (ImageNet), both when ﬁne-tuning and when train-\\ning only a classiﬁer. We observe that the best choice of ex-\\nperts is not affected by the dataset size, and that even with\\nfew examples TASK2VEC is able to ﬁnd the optimal experts.\\nChoice of probe network\\nIn Table 1 we show that\\nDenseNet [15] and ResNet architectures [11] perform sig-\\nniﬁcantly better when used as probe networks to compute\\nthe TASK2VEC embedding than a VGG [32] architecture.\\n6.

However, for general vision tasks which apply\\nto all natural images, the domain is the same across tasks.\\nTaskonomy [39] explores the structure of the space of\\ntasks, focusing on the question of effective knowledge\\ntransfer in a curated collection of 26 visual tasks, ranging\\nfrom classiﬁcation to 3D reconstruction, deﬁned on a com-\\nmon domain. They compute pairwise transfer distances be-\\ntween pairs of tasks and use the results to compute a di-\\nrected hierarchy. Introducing novel tasks requires comput-\\ning the pairwise distance with tasks in the library. In con-\\ntrast, we focus on a larger library of 1,460 ﬁne-grained clas-\\nsiﬁcation tasks both on same and different domains, and\\nshow that it is possible to represent tasks in a topological\\nspace with a constant-time embedding. The large task col-\\nlection and cheap embedding costs allow us to tackle new\\nmeta-learning problems.\\nFisher kernels\\nOur work takes inspiration from Jaakkola\\nand Hausler [16]. They propose the “Fisher Kernel”, which\\nuses the gradients of a generative model score function as a\\nrepresentation of similarity between data items\\nK(x(1), x(2)) = ∇θ log P(x(1)|θ)T F −1∇θ log P(x(2)|θ).\\nHere P(x|θ) is a parameterized generative model and F is\\nthe Fisher information matrix. This provides a way to utilize\\ngenerative models in the context of discriminative learning.\\nVariants of the Fisher kernel have found wide use as a repre-\\nsentation of images [28, 29], and other structured data such\\nas protein molecules [17] and text [30]. Since the genera-\\ntive model can be learned on unlabelled data, several works\\nhave investigated the use of Fisher kernel for unsupervised\\nlearning [14, 31]. [35] learns a metric on the Fisher kernel\\nrepresentation similar to our metric learning approach. Our\\napproach differs in that we use the FIM as a representation\\nof a whole dataset (task) rather than using model gradients\\nas representations of individual data items.\\nFisher Information for CNNs\\nOur approach to task em-\\nbedding makes use of the Fisher Information matrix of a\\nneural network as a characterization of the task. Use of\\nFisher information for neural networks was popularized by\\nAmari [6] who advocated optimization using natural gra-\\ndient descent which leverages the fact that the FIM is an\\nappropriate parameterization-independent metric on statis-\\ntical models. Recent work has focused on approximates of\\nFIM appropriate in this setting (see e.g., [12, 10, 25]). FIM\\nhas also been proposed for various regularization schemes\\n[5, 8, 22, 27], analyze learning dynamics of deep networks\\n[4], and to overcome catastrophic forgetting [19].\\nMeta-learning and Model Selection\\nThe general prob-\\nlem of meta-learning has a long history with much re-\\ncent work dedicated to problems such as neural architecture\\nsearch and hyper-parameter estimation. Closely related to\\nour problem is work on selecting from a library of classi-\\nﬁers to solve a new task [33, 2, 20]. Unlike our approach,\\nthese usually address the question via land-marking or ac-\\ntive testing, in which a few different models are evaluated\\nand performance of the remainder estimated by extension.\\nThis can be viewed as a problem of completing a matrix\\ndeﬁned by performance of each model on each task.\\nA similar approach has been taken in computer vision for\\nselecting a detector for a new category out of a large library\\nof detectors [26, 40, 38].\\n7. Discussion\\nTASK2VEC is an efﬁcient way to represent a task, or the\\ncorresponding dataset, as a ﬁxed dimensional vector. It has\\nseveral appealing properties, in particular its norm corre-\\nlates with the test error obtained on the task, and the co-\\nsine distance between embeddings correlates with natural\\ndistances between tasks, when available, such as the taxo-\\nnomic distance for species classiﬁcation, and the ﬁne-tuning\\ndistance for transfer learning. Having a representation of\\ntasks paves the way for a wide variety of meta-learning\\ntasks. In this work, we focused on selection of an expert\\nfeature extractor in order to solve a new task, especially\\nwhen little training data is present, and showed that using\\nTASK2VEC to select an expert from a collection can sen-\\nsibly improve test performance while adding only a small\\noverhead to the training process.\\nMeta-learning on the space of tasks is an important step\\ntoward general artiﬁcial intelligence. In this work, we in-\\ntroduce a way of dealing with thousands of tasks, enough to\\nenable reconstruct a topology on the task space, and to test\\nmeta-learning solutions. The current experiments highlight\\nthe usefulness of our methods. Even so, our collection does\\nnot capture the full complexity and variety of tasks that one\\nmay encounter in real-world situations. Future work should\\nfurther test effectiveness, robustness, and limitations of the\\nembedding on larger and more diverse collections.\\nReferences\\n[1] iMaterialist Challenge (Fashion) at FGVC5 workshop,\\nCVPR\\n2018.\\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/\\nimaterialist-challenge-fashion-2018.\\n5\\n[2] S.

The gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to\\nthe linear model parameters is:\\n∂ℓ\\n∂w = 1\\nN\\nX\\ni\\n(yi −pi)φ(xi),\\nand the empirical estimate of the Fisher information matrix is:\\nF = E\\nh ∂ℓ\\n∂w\\n\\x12 ∂ℓ\\n∂w\\n\\x13T i\\n= Ey∼pw(y|x)\\n1\\nN\\nX\\ni\\nφ(xi)(yi −pi)2φ(xi)T\\n= 1\\nn\\nX\\ni\\nφ(xi)(1 −pi)piφ(xi)T\\nIn general, we are also interested in the Fisher information of the parameters of the feature extractor φ(x) since this is\\nindependent of the speciﬁcs of the output space y (e.g., for k-way classiﬁcation). Consider a 2-layer network where the\\nfeature extractor uses a sigmoid non-linearity:\\np = σ(wT z)\\nzk = σ(U T\\nk x)\\nand the matrix U speciﬁes the feature extractor parameters and w are parameters of the task-speciﬁc classiﬁer. Taking the\\ngradient w.r.t. parameters we have:\\n∂ℓ\\n∂wj\\n= (y −p)zj\\n∂ℓ\\n∂Ukj\\n= (y −p)wkzk(1 −zk)xj\\nThe Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) consists of blocks:\\n∂ℓ\\n∂wi\\n\\x12 ∂ℓ\\n∂wj\\n\\x13T\\n= (y −p)2zizj\\n∂ℓ\\n∂Uki\\n\\x12 ∂ℓ\\n∂wj\\n\\x13T\\n= (y −p)2zjzk(1 −zk)xi\\n∂ℓ\\n∂Uli\\n\\x12 ∂ℓ\\n∂Ukj\\n\\x13T\\n= (y −p)2wkzk(1 −zk)wlzl(1 −zl)xixj\\nWe focus on the FIM of the probe network parameters which is independent of the dimensionality of the output layer and\\nwrite it in matrix form as:\\n∂ℓ\\n∂Ul\\n\\x12 ∂ℓ\\n∂Uk\\n\\x13T\\n= (y −p)2(1 −zk)zk(1 −zl)zlwkwlxxT\\nNote that each block {l, k} consists of the same matrix (y −p)2 · xxT multiplied by a scalar Skl given as:\\nSkl = (1 −zk)zk(1 −zl)zlwkwl\\nWe can thus write the whole FIM as the expectation of a Kronecker product:\\nF = E[(y −p)2 · S ⊗xxT ]\\nwhere the matrix S can be written as\\nS = wwT ⊙zzT ⊙(1 −z)(1 −z)T\\n(a) Random linear + ReLU\\n(b) Polynomial of degree three\\nFigure 5: Task embeddings computed for a probe network consisting of (a) 10 random linear + ReLU features and (b)\\ndegree three polynomial features projected to 2D using t-SNE. The tasks are random binary partitions of the unit square\\nvisualized in each icon (three tasks are visualized on the left) and cannot be distinguished based purely on the input domain\\nwithout considering target labels. Note that qualitatively similar tasks group together, with more complex tasks (requiring\\ncomplicated decision boundaries) separated from simpler tasks.\\nGiven a task described by N training samples {(xe, ye)}, the FIM can be estimated empirically as\\nF = 1\\nN\\nX\\ne\\npe(1 −pe) · Se ⊗xexT\\ne\\nSe = wwT ⊙zezT\\ne ⊙(1 −ze)(1 −ze)T\\nwhere we take expectation over y w.r.t. the predictive distribution y ∼pw(y|x).\\nExample toy task embedding\\nAs noted in the main text, the FIM depends on the domain embedding, the particular task\\nand its complexity. We illustrate these properties of the task embedding using an “toy” task space illustrated in Figure 5. We\\ngenerate 64 binary classiﬁcation tasks by clustering a uniform grid of points in the XY plane into k ∈[3, 16] clusters using\\nk-means and assigning a half of them to one category. We consider two different feature extractors, which play the role of\\n“probe network”. One is a collection of polynomial functions of degree d = 3, the second is 10 random linear features of the\\nform max(0, ax + by + c) where a and b are sampled uniformly between [−1/2, 1/2] and c between [−1, 1].\\nB. Robust Fisher Computation\\nConsider again the loss function (parametrized with the covariance matrix Σ instead of the precision matrix Λ for conve-\\nnience of notation):\\nL( ˆw; Σ) = Ew∼N ( ˆ\\nw,Σ)[Hpw,ˆp(y|x)] + β KL(N( ˆw, Σ) ∥N(0, σ2I)).\\nWe will make use of the fact that the Fisher Information matrix is a positive semideﬁnite approximation of the Hessian H of\\nthe cross-entropy loss, and coincide with it in local minima [24]. Expanding to the second order around ˆw, we have:\\nL( ˆw; Σ) =Ew∼N ( ˆ\\nw,Σ)[Hp ˆ\\nw,ˆp(y|x) + ∇wHp ˆ\\nw,ˆp(y|x)(w −ˆw) + 1\\n2(w −ˆw)T H(w −ˆw)] + β KL(N( ˆw, Σ) ∥N(0, σ2I))\\n=Hp ˆ\\nw,ˆp(y|x) + 1\\n2tr(ΣH) + β KL(N( ˆw, Σ) ∥N(0, σ2I))\\n=Hp ˆ\\nw,ˆp(y|x) + 1\\n2tr(ΣH) + β\\n2 [ ˆw2\\nσ2 + 1\\nσ2 trΣ + k log σ2 −log(|Σ|) −k]\\nwhere in the last line used the known expression for the KL divergence of two Gaussian. Taking the derivative with respect\\nto Σ and setting it to zero, we obtain that the expression loss is minimized when Σ−1 = 2\\nβ\\n\\x10\\nH +\\nβ\\n2σ2 I\\n\\x11\\n, or, rewritten in term\\nof the precision matrices, when\\nΛ = 2\\nβ\\n\\x10\\nH + βλ2\\n2 I\\n\\x11\\n,\\nwhere we have introduced the precision matrices Λ = Σ−1 and λ2I = 1/σ2I.\\nWe can then obtain an estimate of the Hessian H of the cross-entropy loss at the point ˆw, and hence of the FIM, by\\nminimizing the loss L( ˆw, Λ) with respect to Λ. This is a more robust approximation than the standard deﬁnition, as it\\ndepends on the loss in a whole neighborhood of ˆw of size ∝Λ, rather than from the derivatives of the loss at a point.\\nTo further make the estimation more robust, and to reduce the number of parameters, we constrain Λ to be diagonal, and\\nconstrain weights wij belonging to the same ﬁlter to have the same precision Λij. Optimization of this loss can be performed\\neasily using Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes, and in particular using the local reparametrization trick of [18].\\nThe prior precision λ2 should be picked according to the scale of the weights of each layer. In practice, since the weights\\nof each layer have a different scale, we found it useful to select a different λ2 for each layer, and train it together with Λ,\\nC. Details of the experiments\\nC.1. Training of experts and classiﬁers\\nGiven a task, we train an expert on it by ﬁne-tuning an off-the-shelf ResNet-34 pretrained on ImageNet1. Fine-tuning is\\nperformed by ﬁrst ﬁxing the weights of the network and retraining from scratch only the ﬁnal classiﬁer for 10 epochs using\\nAdam, and then ﬁne-tuning all the network together with SGD for 60 epochs with weight decay 5e-4, starting from learning\\nrate 0.001 and decreasing it by a factor 0.1 at epochs 40.\\nGiven an expert, we train a classiﬁer on top of it by replacing the ﬁnal classiﬁcation layer and training it with Adam for\\n16 epochs. We use weight decay 5e-4 and learning rate 1e-4.\\nThe tasks we train on generally have different number of samples and unbalanced classes. To limit the impact of this\\nimbalance on the training procedure, regardless of the total size of the dataset, in each epoch we always sample 10,000\\nimages with replacement, uniformly between classes. In this way, all epochs have the same length and see approximately the\\nsame number of examples for each class. We use this balanced sampling in all experiments, unless noted otherwise.\\nC.2. Computation of the TASK2VEC embedding\\nAs the described in the main text, the TASK2VEC embedding is obtained by choosing a probe network, retraining the ﬁnal\\nclassiﬁer on the given task, and then computing the Fisher Information Matrix for the weights of the probe network.\\nUnless speciﬁed otherwise, we use an off-the-shelf ResNet-34 pretrained on ImageNet as the probe network. The Fisher\\nInformation Matrix is computed in a robust way minimizing the loss function L( ˆw; Λ) with respect to the precision matrix Λ,\\nas described before. To make computation of the embedding faster, instead of waiting for the convergence of the classiﬁer,\\nwe train the ﬁnal classiﬁer for 2 epochs using Adam and then we continue to train it jointly with the precision matrix Λ using\\nthe loss L( ˆw; Λ). We constrain Λ to be positive by parametrizing it as Λ = exp(L), for some unconstrained variable L.\\nWhile for the classiﬁer we use a low learning rate (1e-4), we found it useful to use an higher learning rate (1e-2) to train L.\\nC.3. Training the MODEL2VECembedding\\nAs described in the main text, in the MODEL2VECembedding we aim to learn a vector representation mj = Fj + bj of\\nthe j-th model in the collection, which represents both the task the model was trained on (through the TASK2VEC embedding\\nFj), and the particularities of the model (through the learned parameter bj).\\nWe learn bj by minimizing a k-way classiﬁcation loss which, given a task t, aims to select the model that performs best\\non the task among a collection of k models. Multiple models may perform similarly and close to optimal: to preserve this\\ninformation, instead of using a one-hot encoding for the best model, we train using soft-labels obtained as follows:\\nˆp(yi) = Softmax\\n\\x10\\n−αerrori −mean(errori)\\nstd(errori)\\n\\x11\\n,\\nwhere errori,j is the ground-truth test error obtained by training a classiﬁer for task i on top of the j-th model. Notice that\\nfor α ≫1, the soft-label yj\\ni reduces to the one-hot encoding of the index of the best performing model. However, for lower\\nα’s, the vector yi contains richer information about the relative performance of the models.\\n1https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html\\nWe obtain our prediction in a similar way: Let di,j = dasym(ti, mj), then we set our model prediction to be\\np(y|di,0, . . . , di,k) = Softmax(−γ di),\\nwhere the scalar γ > 0 is a learned parameter. Finally, we learn both the mj’s and γ using a cross-entropy loss:\\nL = 1\\nN\\nN\\nX\\ni=0\\nEyi∼ˆp[p(yi|di,0, . . . , di,k)],\\nwhich is minimized precisely when p(y|di,0, . . . , di,k) = ˆp(yi).\\nIn our experiments we set α = 20, and minimize the loss using Adam with learning rate 0.05, weight decay 0.0005, and\\nearly stopping after 81 epochs, and report the leave-one-out error (that is, for each task we train using the ground truth of all\\nother tasks and test on that task alone, and report the average of the test errors obtained in this way).\\nD. Datasets, tasks and meta-tasks\\nOur two model selection meta-tasks, iNat+CUB and Mixed, are curated as follows. For iNat+CUB, we generated 50\\ntasks and (the same) experts from iNaturalist and CUB. The 50 tasks consist of 25 iNaturalist tasks and 25 CUB tasks to\\nprovide a balanced mix from two datasets of the same domain. We generated the 25 iNaturalist tasks by grouping species\\ninto orders and then choosing the top 25 orders with the most samples. The number of samples for tasks shows the heavy-tail\\ndistribution typical of real data, with the top task having 64,100 samples (the Passeriformes order classiﬁcation task), while\\nmost tasks have around 6, 000 samples.\\nThe 25 CUB tasks were similarly generated with 10 order tasks but additionally has 15 Passeriformes family tasks: After\\ngrouping CUB into orders, we determined 11 usable order tasks (the only unusable order task, Gaviiformes, has only one\\nspecies so it makes no sense to train on it). However, one of the orders—Passeriformes—dominated all other orders with 134\\nspecies when compared to 3-24 species of other orders. Therefore, we decided to further subdivide the Passeriformes order\\ntask into family tasks (i.e., grouping species into families) to provide a more balanced partition. This resulted in 15 usable\\nfamily tasks (i.e., has more than one species) out of 22 family tasks. Unlike iNaturalist, tasks from CUB have only a few\\nhundreds of samples and hence beneﬁt more from carefully selecting an expert.\\nIn the iNAT+CUB meta-task the classiﬁcation tasks are the same tasks used to train the experts. To avoid trivial solu-\\ntions (always selecting the expert trained on the task we are trying to solve) we test in a leave-one-out fashion: given a\\nclassﬁcication task, we aim to select the best expert that was not trained on the same data.\\nFor the Mixed meta-task, we chose 40 random tasks and 25 curated experts from all datasets. The 25 experts were\\ngenerated from iNaturalist, iMaterialist and DeepFashion (CUB, having fewer samples than iNaturalist, is more appropriate\\nas tasks). For iNaturalist, we trained 15 experts: 8 order tasks and 7 class tasks (species ordered by class), both with number\\nof samples greater than 10,000. For DeepFashion, we trained 3 category experts (upper-body, lower-body, full-body). For\\niMaterialist, we trained 2 category experts (pants, shoes) and 5 multi-label experts by grouping attributes (color, gender,\\nneckline, sleeve, style). For the purposes of clustering attributes into larger groups for training experts (and color coding\\nthe dots in Figure 1), we obtained a de-anonymized list of the iMaterialist Fashion attribute names from the FGCV contest\\norganizers.\\nThe 40 random tasks were generated as follows. In order to balance tasks among all datasets, we selected 5 CUB, 15\\niNaturalist, 15 iMaterialist and 5 DeepFashion tasks. Within those datasets, we randomly pick tasks with a sufﬁcient number\\nof validation samples and maximum variety. For the iNaturalist tasks, we group the order tasks into class tasks, ﬁlter out\\nthe number of validation samples less than 100 and randomly pick order tasks within each class. For the iMaterialist tasks,\\nwe similarly group the tasks (e.g. category, style, pattern), ﬁlter out tasks with less than 1,000 validation samples and\\nrandomly pick tasks within each group. For CUB, we randomly select 2 order tasks and 3 Passeriformes family tasks, and\\nfor DeepFashion, we randomly select the tasks uniformly. All this ensures that we have a balanced variety of tasks.\\nFor the data efﬁciency experiment, we trained on a subset of the tasks and experts in the Mixed meta-task: We picked\\nthe Accipitriformes, Asparagales, Upper-body, Short Sleeves for the tasks, and the Color, Lepidoptera, Upper-body, Passer-\\niformes, Asterales for the experts. Tasks where selected among those that have more than 30,000 training samples in order\\nto represent all datasets. The experts were also selected to be representative of all datasets, and contain both strong and very\\nweak experts (such as the Color expert).\\nE.

The numbers in each cell is the test error obtained by training a classiﬁer on a given combination of task (rows)\\nand expert (columns). The background color represent the Asymmetric TASK2VEC distance between the target task and\\nthe task used to train the expert. Numbers in red indicate the selection made by the model selection algorithm based on\\nthe Asymmetric TASK2VEC embedding. The (out-of-diagonal) optimal expert (when different from the one selected by our\\nalgorithm), is highlighted in blue. (Right) Same as before, but for the Mixed meta-task.\\n'}]"
